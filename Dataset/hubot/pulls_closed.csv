```javascript

robot = new Hubot.Robot(null, 'shell', true, '/')

robot = new Hubot.Robot({adapter: 'shell',  alias: '/'})

I updated `Robot` to take just the one `params`. It still works in the old way, but uses [depd](https://github.com/dougwilson/nodejs-depd) to print a deprecation warning. I'm open to just logging a message, but I was looking for something with decent output, and included line information. I was also thinking it'd make sense to have an 'upgrading' guide, that talks about specific things that need to be fixed, like this, and the deprecation could link back to it somehow.

I also deprecated `Hubot.loadBot` in favor of the constructor, since it doesn't seem to be doing a whole lot except constructing a bot. I could remove that if it it seems like that would be problematic.

We've got some Hubot scripts which make use of `async`/`await` [via Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-to-generator/). It keeps things fairly readable while we do stuff like make API calls.

Here's a simplified example (please excuse the JS and any CS weirdness... I rarely write CS!):

``` js
// test.js

module.exports = function(robot){
  robot.respond(/test/i, async function(msg){
    msg.send('starting');
    await delay(1000);
    msg.send('ending');
  });
};

function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve){
    setTimeout(resolve, ms);
  });
}
```

And an example test script that uses [hubot-test-helper](https://github.com/mtsmfm/hubot-test-helper):

``` js
// test.spec.js

import Helper from 'hubot-test-helper';

const helper = new Helper('./test.js');

describe('test script', function(){
  it('should complete', async function(){
    const room = helper.createRoom();
    await room.user.say('seinfeld', '@hubot test');
    expect(room.messages).to.deep.eq([
      ['seinfeld', '@hubot test'],
      ['hubot', 'starting'],
      ['hubot', 'ending']
    ]);
    room.destroy();
  });
});
```

Currently the above test fails, since the `ending` message is not received before the test finishes. [On closer inspection](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/src/listener.coffee#L62), this appears to be due to the `listener` not handling callbacks that return promises.

One way to fix things is to update the `listener` as per this PR, but is this worth progressing further?

- scopedHTTPClient.coffee, which contains functionality for `robot.http`

**There should be no user-facing changes to how hubot works**. bin/hubot works as normal; http servers, aliases, etc use the same defaults as before. (It does expose a `setupRouter` function, but that functionality already existed by overwriting `@router` anyways.)

The purpose of this is so that one can use the ""basebot"" for all of hubot's functionality, without having to also require autoloading of files. For example, one may want to precompile hubot + scripts into a single, dead-code-eliminated javascript file for lower memory usage and startup time (which is my particular usecase- precompile the coffeescript.) Or, maybe you want a client-side hubot loaded because you're a mad genius doing crazy things. _many possibilities._

Should `respond` also notify the `@adapter` of the name change? (I suppose the server, too, needs to change the bot's name.)

My use case for this has to do with IRC. Under certain conditions, Hubot can be assigned an alternate nickname when connecting to the server. I'd like to be able to reassign the primary name when it becomes possible, without restarting Hubot.

I can't think of a case where the alias would need to be changed regularly, but maybe that should be possible, at least to be consistent.

> I'd also wonder if there's any caveats to supporting this. Imagine I'm talking to hubot in one room, and someone changes the name somewhere else. I'd expect hubot to still be respond, but it'd start silently ignoring me until I found the new name.

Maybe Hubot could announce his new name?

- `Robot` constructor has positional arguments, which means they don't make much sense when you are looking at `new Hubot.Robot(null, 'shell', false, 'Hubot', '/')`
- `adapter` is loaded at Robot construction time. the `loadAdapter` is just a wrapper around loading a builtin adapter vs a npm module
- `loadAdapter` expects an adapter's exports to define a `use` method, and in reality, that seems to only ever return a new instance of the adapter that takes a robot. Why not construct this directly?
- loading an npm script package looks weird. we require it only to call it with the robot. this is the problem of the script API exporting a function though

What this does so far:
- constructor can now be called without any args
- update builtin adapter to export the adapter class, and make those accessible from top-level `require 'hubot'`
- don't load adapter if one wasn't given (in the case of constructor without any arg)
- add `loadScriptPackage` helper, which reads a little better but doesn't do much

Some open-ended questions / problems:
- making sure to preserve backwards compatibility
- handling environment specific configuration. should you hard-code name, alias, etc? environment variable? assign from an environment variable? should there be like a `config/environments.coffee` like Rails has, and `config/environments/development.coffee` for dev, `config/environments/production.coffee` for production, etc?
- does this make it easier to test? harder?
- does `bin/hubot` need to exist? does it need to support a programatic launch, or do you only use progmatic launch OR bin/hubot?

I'm not a big fan of this piece of code because it shares a lot with `respondPattern` and, it depends heavily on the `respond` regex.
An alternate solution is to reconstruct regular expressions using `respondPattern`. This strategy would, however, require to save the original regex (the message part that follows the robot's name/alias) in the TextListener object.

I modified the express middleware that is used in custom HTTP listeners (routers) so that a hubot user can access the actual body of the request as a string object. 

The need for this is described in #923 . It's probably impossible to access the unprocessed body without monkey-patching hubot itself.

I need this for validating github webhooks that use HMAC.
I added an example in the documentation how to do this.

Accessing the body in express 3.x and testing middlewares is hard. After trying different approaches I decided to implement this solution: http://stackoverflow.com/a/26634372/807339 .

Mocha has a hard time detecting assert errors inside routers in the test cases. Therefore I had to rethrow them in the test context/namespace.

This mod pushes the stored documentation to an accessible @scriptDocumentation property so that other modules/scripts can make use of it (see https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-advanced-help, for example, which is a module I wrote that assumes this property exists). In the absence of this property, I'm going to have to resort to opening sibling scripts and parsing in the documentation even though the robot.coffee script already does that (it just does nothing with the data).

This is a work-in-progress. I'm opening it early, because there's several parts I'd like feedback on.

This is inspired heavily by @michaelansel's work over in https://github.com/github/hubot/pull/803. We have been abusing `robot.respond /.*/` quite a bit in order to accomplish similar goals, and that pull was eye-opening. This pull does not include an equivalent of the listener metadata from that pull, because that pull does it so elegantly it does not seem worthwhile to revisit. We should get that into master no matter what.

The middleware itself, however, was a little uncomfortable for a few of our use cases. I played around with it and implemented a few things and came up with these issues:
- They only apply to one phase of a message, ""when a listener has matched."" I found distinct use cases for at least 3 places (read on).
- The name 'middleware' has a lot of context from its use in e.g. express, but these do a different thing. They don't have access to responses, for example, and an incoming message can create several responses. It's a hook, not a middleware.
- It makes listeners async. This complicates testing and would be breaking the API enough that I think it would require calling it 3.0.
- It added a dependency, and I always want to examine that closely.

This pull adds support for 3 hooks: `prereceive`, `prelisten`, and `prereply`. They run before any listeners have executed, before an individual listener executes, and before any message is sent, respectively.

An example of a `prereceive` hook that blacklists a room but for certain users:

``` coffeescript
  robot.prereceive (hook) ->
    if blacklistedRoom(hook.message) && !whitelistedUser(hook.message)
      if hook.message.text.match(/^(\/|hubot)/) # if the message starts with / or 'hubot'
        hook.response.reply ""I'm sorry, but I'm configured to ignore commands from this room.""
      # But ignore everything, even hear commands.
      hook.finish()
```

An example of a `prelisten` hook, taken from #803. It assumes the listener middleware, which is not in this pull:

``` coffeescript
 # node-statsd like interface
  stats =
    increment: (key) ->
      console.log ""#{key}:1|c""
      # noop
robot.prelisten (hook) ->
    listenerId = hook.listener.options?.id
    if listenerId?
      stats.increment ""hubot.listeners.total.#{listenerId}""
      if hook.response.message.user?.name?
        stats.increment ""hubot.listeners.by_user.#{hook.response.message.user.name}.#{listenerId}""
      if hook.response.message.user?.room?
        stats.increment ""hubot.listeners.by_room.#{hook.response.message.user.room}.#{listenerId}""
```

An example of a `prereply` hook. This prevents sending a message that matches `/passwords/`:

``` coffeescript
robot.prereply (hook) ->
  if hook.reply.text.match(/passwords/)
    hook.finish()
```

And this changes the outgoing message:

``` coffeescript
robot.prereply (hook) ->
  if hook.reply.text.match(/passwords/)
    hook.reply.text = ""Sorry meatbag, no passwords.""
```

I am pretty happy with the hook API as used, but I still need to do some more testing. I'm very interested in feedback, though.

I'm less happy with what happened in the guts. There are a few cases where things could be cleaned up internally if we refactored a few things. For example, `Response`s don't know about their `Listener`s, so a `prereceive` hook constructor needs a response, likewise a `prelistener` and its `Listener`. So the Hook API needs to handle both, but if responses had an when a smarter API might let it handle them a little more elegantly. If we like this direction, this pull would get a bit bigger as I did some reworking internally.

I took this project on mainly just because I wanted to see if I could do it. I'm fairly sure there's a better way to do this, but _it works_. If this is on the right track and can be made to work with some tweaking, I'd love to see it merged. I'm also happy to rewrite based on advice for a different approach if that's plausible. And if this piques someone's interest to it a better way themselves, I'm happy just seeing the feature make it whether it's me that creates it or not.

One change that probably needs to be made is to fix it so it _only_ works when you address hubot directly. Currently he just listens to anything you say while a conversation is active with him, which could lead to some issues if trying to talk to coworkers and hubot simultaneously. Think: accidentally deploying your lunch plans to production. I'm not sure the best way to do that, which is what leads me to believe there's a better way to do all of this.

Any pointers would be appreciated. Once I know whether this is likely to be merged or not, I'll happily write docs and tests where necessary.

Seems that the express version that hubot is using (v3.3.4), has a wildcard for `debug`:
https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/3.3.4/package.json#L35

This allowed a sneaky version bump from v0.8.1 to v1.0.0, which has the suspect `ms` package seen in the error.

The next minor version that constrains the `debug`package is v3.4.8:
https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/3.4.8/package.json#L36

I'll test it out and submit a PR, if that sounds alright.

Here's the CHANGELOG diff, but it should be anything breaking:

Looks like instantiating a new Robot will attach an 'uncaughtException' handler to the main process object using an anonymous function.  This listener is never cleaned up, even when shutdown is explicitly called.  I've added a function emitError that can be referenced when removing the event listener.
#### Issue

The issue is that when a robot is created and shut down multiple times (my use case is unit tests, but there may be others) the event listener for 'uncaughtException' is never removed.  I'll specifically receive a warning in this when running my unit tests, you can see that in the travis-ci link below.  Feel free to use my plugin to reproduce.

I was able to trace it down to the `brain.userForId` function, which I then updated to solve the issue. I'm going to outline the failure and the changes made to fix it below. If I'm missing anything as far as why this function was originally coded like it was then I can look at fixing the issue in other ways, but in the context I can see this fix is fairly straightforward. 
### The Issue

Ever since we started using the brain to store info on users we noticed a strange failure where new users weren't having @mention_names assigned. 

What appears to be the problem is initially when users are created (in hipchat) they don't have @mention_names. Hubot adds them to the brain as soon as they exist. Then when @mention_name is set the `userForId` function is called again it doesn't update the brain because of the conditions on [line 109](https://github.com/templaedhel/hubot/compare/github:master...templaedhel:userforid-reconciliation?expand=1#diff-3f212f83b49bd9f3b418259c1f06c0cfL109). 
### The Fix

I removed all the logic around if and when to update users in the brain. Now `userForId` will always return the user for the given ID, as well as updating it with any additional attributes passed in. 

This fixes our issue. 
### Several Questions Remain
- Is there a reason behind the complicated logic around only updating if `options.room` isn't set on the existing user? Tracing back through git didn't dig up anything interesting. I also have trouble seeing how these changes will break any logical uses of this function

My PR implements Adapter#custom raw method and Response#custom method. 
Adapter#custom should be extended by adapters that require some additional message types to be sent. 

According to usecase of slack described in related PR it might look something like this:

``` coffee-script
robot.respond /foo$/i, (msg) ->
  data = 
    type: 'slack-attachment'
    content:
      text: ""Optional text that should appear within the attachment""

in this case adapter should handle itself how to parse objects received and send them back to a chat in appropriate way.

```
$ source ./shell-config  # file eg.  export HUTOT_ENV_VAR=""...""
$ source ./heroku-config  # file eg.  heroku config:add HUBOT_ENV_VAR=""...""
```

When reusing the same configuration variables in development and production environments I've found it easier just to specify hubot's env vars in a single json file that gets called at runtime. 

Maybe others will find it useful as well...

Adds `-i, --config PATH` option to `bin/hubot`.

Usage:

```
$ bin/hubot --config config.json
```

or

```
$ bin/hubot -i config.json
```

Example `config.json`:

```
{
  ""HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT: ""..."",
  ""HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ROOMS: ""..."",
  ""HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN: ""...""
}
```

Which in turn adds the configuration vars to `process.env` to be used by hubot scripts.

349,6,13,0,Externals,wingrunr21,2012-09-13 15:09:16,0,0,0,0,"I needed the ability for hubot to react to topic changes in Campfire as well as the ability to query the Campfire room for information (like the current topic).

I made changes that allow hubot to ""see"" a message.  The function will allow a String, Regex, or actual object name to be specified as what to watch for:

```
module.exports = (robot) ->
  robot.see ""TopicChangeMessage"", (msg) ->
    # do something fun
  robot.see /TopicChangeMessage/, (msg) ->
    # works for funness as well
  robot.see TopicChangeMessage, (msg) ->
    # just remember to require TopicChangeMessage...
```

The <tt>enter</tt> and <tt>leave</tt> events have been updated to use this common way of reacting to message types.

I also added an <tt>info</tt> utility function to the Campfire adaptor.  It is possible I missed something more obvious for using it, but here is what I am currently using:

```
robot.respond /topic/, (msg) ->
  user = msg.message.user
  room = user.room

  robot.adapter.bot.Room(room).info (err, data) ->
    topic = data.room.topic

The command line parses `-a adapter1,adapter2,...` and passes that as an array to the `Robot` constructor which will loop through each and attempt to require the adapter and add it to the `@adapters` array.

It is during this load you could effectively load external adapters by trying to `require ""adapter""` which would have been installed via `npm`, and if that fails try loading a local adapter.

The multiple adapter support feels still a bit ""hacked"" together, so extra eyes looking at the code could help suggest alternative ways for parts.

Updated the `bin/hubot` with a `-r`/`--redis` flag which uses the `Robot.RedisBrain` instead of the plain `Robot.Brain`. The default can be switched around if people would prefer the Redis brain.
