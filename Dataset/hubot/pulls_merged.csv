This PR adds Istanbul to measure test coverage and add settings to track coverage over time with https://coveralls.io 

We (@gr2m and me) think this is crucial for adding `semantic-release` and Greenkeeper to Hubot, both of which depend on reliable tests, and ideally 100% coverage. `semantic-release` uses tests to determine whether a commit introduces breaking changes, and Greenkeeper uses tests to determine whether a dependency update breaks Hubot. We’d like to automate away as much of the release process as possible (to make it more convenient, so we can release more often, and to avoid [sentimental versioning](http://sentimentalversioning.org/), and we’d like to use Greenkeeper to be sure that users don’t get frustrated with Hubot because some dependency broke it without us noticing. 

- `npm test` now displays coverage information at the end of each test run
- The readme now shows build status and coverage info badges
- Hubot has a status page on coveralls.io (check this page from `hoodiehq/hoodie` https://coveralls.io/github/hoodiehq/hoodie to see what this looks like)

Coveralls.io requires additional configuration:

- [x] An admin/owner of `github/hubot` must sign in to https://coveralls.io with their GitHub account
- [x] On https://coveralls.io/repos/new , enable `github/hubot`
- [x] On https://coveralls.io/github/{username}/hubot/settings, disable `leave comments`
- [x] On the same page, set `coverage decrease threshold for failure` to `0` and save changes
- [x] Check `coveralls/coveralls` in `Require status checks to pass before merging` on https://github.com/github/hubot/settings/branches/master

Having the declaration of `MockAdapter` inside the Hubot repository makes sense anyway, it is fairly simple and we depend on it in our tests, so we should have full control.

But at this point I have the source code working in JavaScript and all existing coffee script tests are passing, so I thought I’d be a good time to start sharing progress.

### 🛑 this PR is not yet ready for any feedback on the code

Most of it is still generated from `decaffeinate`. I’ll test the current version with some popular adapters / scripts first to makes sure it all still works

closes – eventually – https://github.com/hubotio/evolution/pull/4

### Breaking Changes

- node@0.10 and node@0.12 are no longer supported
- `require('hubot/src/adapter')` does no longer work. It was never officially supported, but now it won’t work at all. Use `require('hubot').Adapter` instead
- `Middleware.ticker()` has been removed. Use `process.nextTick()` instead

### Features

- We now export es2015 `class` declarations of all Hubot classes at `require('hubot/es2015')`. 

### Progress

All steps will be part of the same PR but split into separate commits so people
can follow more easily.

#### Convert source files from CoffeeScript to JavaScript

Convert all source files from CoffeeScript to JavaScript with a tool like [decaffeinate](https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate), see also [github/hubot#1138](https://github.com/github/hubot/issues/1138).

Make sure the existing tests (still written in CoffeeScript) run against the new JavaScript.

Now go through each file and improve the code readability by hand as needed. From my experiences with converting Hoodie from CoffeeScript to JavaScript quite a lot of manual work will be required.

#### Convert test files from CoffeeScript to JavaScript

Same as the previous steps only for the tests files this time.

When finished, create a separate branch with the tests written in JavaScript but the source code still in CoffeeScript to assure integrity.

<a name=""package-json""></a>
#### Update package.json

Remove all CoffeeScript related dependencies and tooling. Update [engines](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines)

Make sure that Hubot scripts can still be written in CoffeeScript. We want to break as few existing scripts as possible and many of them are written in CoffeeScript. We treat it as legacy support and will drop support for scripts written in CoffeeScript in future.

<a name=""linting""></a>
#### Add script for JavaScript linting

The only tool I would like to introduce as part of this proposal is a linting tool which will be run as part of `npm test`.

I suggest [standard](https://standardjs.com/). We’ve been using it in all our projects at Hoodie and Neighbourhoodie since 2+ years and never looked back. It's a zero-configuration JavaScript linter.

Instructions to test an existing adapter with this PR:

1. Check out the `evolution/4/javascript` branch of this pull request

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:github/hubot.git
   cd hubot
   git checkout evolution/4/javascript
   npm install
   npm link
   ```

2. Now link it into your test app using an example adapter

   Using the example of slack here:

   ```
   npm install -g yo generator-hubot
   mkdir my-awesome-hubot && cd my-awesome-hubot
   yo hubot --adapter=slack
   npm link hubot
   ```

3. Now start hubot

   ```
   NODE_PATH=`pwd`/node_modules HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=<your token here> ./bin/hubot --adapter slack
   ```

   replace `<your token here>` with your own bots token from slack",4912,True,en,14

The hubot-weixin-adapter is running very well, it serves us in lots of scenarios and makes lots of fun for us.

Could you help update the [adapters.md](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/adapters.md) for the [page](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/), to add this new hubot-weixin into the adapter list and link to our github repo? Thanks in advance.

 and eventually passed ot the constructor in robot.coffee. This is used by Robot
to determine where to load builtin adapters from.

It also makes it hard to progmatically construct a robot without running bin/hubot,
since you'd need to find a way to figure out the path that the hubot module is installed.

This changes it so Robot will determine the adapterPath since it's relative to where
it live. The constructor still takes it as an option so it remains backward compatible
 to anything that might be specifying it.

I also find it more discoverable than a directory of shell scripts or make targets because an npm project _always_ has a package.json, and therefore npm-scripts are there by default. 
- scripts/bootstrap still remains, though it is largely unnecessary (all it does now is source .env files, which probably ought to be it's own npm utility and thus easily done directly in npm-scripts)
- bootstrap is run automatically before `test` and `start` scripts (via `pretest` and `prestart`)
- `start` is the old script/server
- `test` is the mocha test suite (script/test and make test)
- `clean` removes the lib directory (coffee-compiled JS); was the old make remove-js target
- `test:smoke` runs the smoke-test (was script/smoke-test)
- `release` is the old script/release. It's broken into three steps: prerelease (which does the npm-update and smoke-test); then 'release' via npm-version (bump/tag/commit); and finally postrelease (npm-publish and git-push). If any step fails, the subsequent steps are aborted.
- `compile` is the old generate-js make target
- `compile:watch` is the old make dev target (could easily be renamed but I think this is clearer)
- `package` is the old make package target

Other notes:
- npm-scripts provide tab completion (`npm run com<TAB>` -> `npm run compile`)
- `npm run` prints a list of all configured scripts for easy usage/help, showing what's available
- npm-scripts automatically prepend `node_modules/.bin` to `$PATH` so PATH manipulation is unnecessary
- npm-scripts support package.json introspection via environment variables that map directly to the package.json structure (e.g. `$npm_package_version`)
- npm-scripts support user/custom configuration with global and local `.npmrc` files that are quite useful. (i.e. configuring test reporters, for instance. so for example, mocha default reporter could be `spec`, but overridden on CI to `tap` while Rando Dev could configure theirs to be `dot`)

When hubot is started with an alias that is a substring of the robot's name weird things happen. Messages addressing the robot via his name can get matched by alias and the remaining chars from the name are being appended to the pattern. That breaks some hubot scripts.

For example the plugin hubot-auth has the following respond regex:
`robot.respond /@?(.+) ha(s|ve) ([""'\w: -_]+) role/i, (msg) ->`
So if we start hubot like this:
 `./bin/hubot --name william --alias will`
and try to give John a developer role

```
william> william john has developer role
Shell: iam john does not exist
william>
```

we will get surprised that Hubot can't find John because it looks for ""iam John"" where ""iam"" is a left-over from the robot name.

This should fix https://github.com/github/hubot/issues/826 and https://github.com/github/hubot/issues/845 . It replaces using readline and readline-history with [cline](https://github.com/kucoe/cline), because it has a lot better interface. In particular, it does have a hook to managing a history. I just had to write some code to load it initially, and to truncate it at the end.

I also replaced the hard-coded terminal color output with [chalk](https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk), so it's a lot easier to know what it's even doing.

Like in Express, middleware can interrupt the response process, preventing the Listener callback from ever being executed. Middleware can perform operations both on the way towards the Listener callback (before callback execution) and on the way away from the Listener callback (after callback execution/middleware interrupt).

As a side effect, listeners are now executed asynchronously. Behavior around message.done should remain the same (process until message.done is true).

Example usage (imposes authorization policy on all scripts): https://github.com/michaelansel/hubot-rbac/blob/master/src/rbac.coffee

API Change:
- `Robot.receive` and `Listener.call` are now asynchronous. Any external code depending on knowing when all Listeners have been tested (in `receive`) or when the Listener callback has finished executing (in `call`) will need to be updated to use the new callback parameter. Code that doesn't care about timing should continue to work without modification.

I originally set out to fork @patcon's https://github.com/technicalpickles/generator-hubot and https://github.com/patcon/generator-hubot-script, but ended working through the various yeoman tutorials, and the styles ended up quite different. Between that and wanting to add a bit more functionality to the bot generator, and using namesapces, I ended up with  https://github.com/technicalpickles/generator-hubot 

In particular, I've removed basically all the generated scripts in favor of external ones. That has been a serious maintenance burden burden and point of friction for new users. I've moved those all to external scripts on the hubot-scripts org.

I intend to move that generator either to the github org or hubot-scripts org, haven't decided which. A minor thing I think I'd like to see is instead of `yo hubot:script`, make it explicit about `yo hubot:external_script` versus a `yo hubot:local_script` for generating a package versus a script inside the hubot directory you are in.

I also hadn't decided how to handle the heroko support. I had talked to @tombell at some point about including a script like `hubot-heroku-keepalive` that would be look for a HEROKU_URL like your heroku remote, create a HTTP endpoint, and handle setting up a `setInterval` to ping that endpoint ever whatever seconds. That's kindof a nice-to-have though.

Thoughts?

hubot adds a `process.on 'uncaughtException'` handler, and calls `invokeErrorHandlers`. This goes through all the error handlers configured with `robot.error` and invokes them in turn.

The production hubot I normally test against has it's own error handler, so I wasn't able to spot it there. And it turns out the shell adapter has it's own `process.on 'uncaughtException'` handler, so whenever I did testing, it was getting displayed using that, rather than the builtin one :sweat: 

This seems to work so far with the shell adapter, but definitely need to test with campfire and other adapters to confirm, which is a bit more work.

As part of this, I added a `scripts/boomtown.coffee` for testing. If you do `bin/hubot`, it'll load the scripts you get with new bots (ie `src/scripts`, and also these new ones. I intend this `scripts` directory to be for testing hubot itself.

Tested this briefly, and seems to work as expected.

My only concern at the moment has to do with `package.json` entry. This should be flexible, but we might need to be updating the minimal version as hubot-auth, which wouldn't be great. It might be better to do something like `npm install hubot-auth --save`, so it'll grab the latest version and lock it at a particular minor version (ie `~1.1.2`).

- API for specifying error handlers in hubot scripts
- An 'error' event type that can be emitted, and is consumed by any error handlers
- A `process.on 'uncaughtException'` handler to emit errors through these error handlers
- Documentation for the above

It's worth noting that the [uncaughtExeption handler documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_event_uncaughtexception) says:

> Note that uncaughtException is a very crude mechanism for exception handling and may be removed in the future.
> 
> Don't use it, use domains instead. If you do use it, restart your application after every unhandled exception!

So, it's pretty scary for sure. We've been using it internally our our own hubot for 6 months or so without any problems yet.

```
robot.respond /PING$/, (msg) ->
  if msg.message.private
    msg.send ""PONG""
  else
    msg.send ""Sorry, I only respond to pings in locked rooms.""

`private` will be `true` for locked rooms, `false` for unlocked rooms, and `undefined` for rooms where no lock message has been seen since restart.
#### Setting responses as private:

```
robot.respond /PING$/, (msg) ->

If the room is locked before the trigger, hubot will just answer. If not, he'll lock it, answer, and  unlock it.

As a side effect of how I implemented all of this, you can now do callbacks after send:

```
robot.respond /PING$/, (msg) ->
  msg.send ""hello"", ->
    console.log ""This is printed after sending hello""

The motivation for this was  an issue last week where I had scripts in `hubot-scripts.json`, but somehow my install of hubot-scripts was missing a bunch of scripts were simply missing. Most notably was redis-brain.coffee, which meant it looked like hubot's brain wasn't persisting between restarts... which it wasn't, since it was using the default in memory brain.

I know that particular issue was probably a fluke, but I'm hoping to make it more clear when there's hubot-breaking issues at startup like it. Off hand, it'd be particularly useful for new users adding their scripts (which would exit with error on syntax error), or if they make an error in `hubot-scripts` (which would exit with error on json syntax error, or if the script doesn't exist), etc.

This should be a pretty safe set of changes, but if there's any users that have errors like this now exits on, they are obviously going to have failures at startup, but that is probably for the best. I think that puts this as a minor version bump, rather than a patch version.

The use of the repo wiki will be deprecated as 'too many cooks spoilt the broth' by editing it a lot with their own ways of doing things.

I want to base the docs off the stuff I started writing for my hubot book (https://github.com/tombell/lhthw I may finish writing it this year, maybe).

I also want to update the README to reflect what `hubot` as a package is, and mainly direct people who wish to hack on the core library rather than 'set up' hubot (directions to the docs will be given).

Some initial points:

Heroku will be officially supported way of deploying hubot, because there are many different ways to 'deploy' hubot to UNIX(-like) operating systems. We can document how to get to a point where you can run `bin/hubot <opts>` on UNIX, but documenting all the ways to handle this like upstart/init scripts etc is outside the scope of the docs for hubot.

Some tasks to get going:
- [x] start initial docs/ directory, copying wiki page
- [x] document creating new hubot
- [x] link to known third party adapters in `docs/adapters.md`
- [x] flesh out CONTRIBUTING.md
- [x] document deploying to heroku
- [x] document deploy to unix (very basic, assume user has installed node, npm, etc, and only cover getting hubot running
- [x] document common things you'd want to do in a script (hear vs respond, random, http, router)
- [x] update src/template/README.md with any info that was in original README.md that would be useful
- [x] update specific wiki to point at new docs after this been merged

Attempting to tell Hubot to ""/play sound"" with `msg.send` does nothing but echo the words. In order to play the sound you need to issue a special sound message. This is in the `Campfire` adapter, but in order to use it, you need to traverse the entire `robot` structure. Additionally, since the `Shell` does not have a `bot`, this condition needs to be checked to prevent errors when testing locally:

``` coffee
module.exports = (robot) ->
  robot.respond /play( me)? (.*)/i, (msg) ->
    msg.send ""I'm going to play #{msg.match[2]} for you""
    msg.robot.adapter.bot?.Room(msg.user.room).sound msg.match[2]
```

This doesn't provide a clean (or intuitive) method for interacting with Campfire. This patch adds the `play` method to the `Campfire` adapter (and to `Shell` so that the scripts can be tested locally). It also patches on to the `Response` message to allow for users to have an intuitive interface:

``` coffee
module.exports = (robot) ->
  robot.respond /play( me)? (.*)/i, (msg) ->
    msg.send ""I'm going to play #{msg.match[2]} for you""
    msg.play msg.match[2]
```

It was decided to not attempt to patch this directly into `send` switching on the leading string ""/play"" as that felt a little too magical.

Also, no changes to `README.md` were made as this feels more adapter specific and should go on the wiki pages if accepted.
