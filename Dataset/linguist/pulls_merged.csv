I've also added a proper CLI interface to the compiler:

```
~/src/gopath/src/github.com/github/linguist vmg/compiler-err 1:$ ./script/grammar-compiler 
NAME:
   Linguist Grammars Compiler - Compile user-submitted grammars and check them for errors

USAGE:
   grammar-compiler [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.0.0

COMMANDS:
     add      add a new grammar source
     update   update grammars.yml with the contents of the grammars library
     compile  convert the grammars from the library
     help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --linguist-path value  path to Linguist root (default: ""/src/linguist"")
   --help, -h             show help
   --version, -v          print the version
```

You can now do fancier stuff like skipping errors and things.

This leads to the following exception:

```
git-linguist failed: fatal: Unable to read current working directory: No such file or directory
/data/github/releases/deploy-b/vendor/gems/2.4.3/ruby/2.4.0/gems/github-linguist-5.3.3/bin/git-linguist:122:in `pwd': No such file or directory - getcwd (Errno::ENOENT)

	from /data/github/releases/deploy-b/bin/git-linguist:8:in `load'
	from /data/github/releases/deploy-b/bin/git-linguist:8:in `<main>'
```

Yes, ideally the job should be removed before it's run, but until then, this PR goes towards addressing this by a) not attempting to print the current directory in the event it goes missing, and b) printing the error to STDERR instead of raising another exception.

The lack of the directory in the error message reduces user-friendliness ever-so-slightly, but the removal of the exception improves it vastly.

Previously when run on a non-repo directory:

```
$ ~/github/linguist/bin/git-linguist stats
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
/Users/lildude/github/linguist/bin/git-linguist:123:in `git_linguist': git-linguist must be run in a Git repository (/Users/lildude/Downloads/trash/foo.XX) (RuntimeError)
	from /Users/lildude/github/linguist/bin/git-linguist:150:in `<main>'
$
```

Now...

```
$ ~/github/linguist/bin/git-linguist
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
git-linguist must be run in a Git repository
$
```

I did think of keeping the directory in the message and catching `Errno::ENOENT` but that would still have left a pretty 🤢  user-experience for peeps running on the CLI and would then have led to a RuntimeError we'd need to catch to keep our internal monitoring happy.  I like to think this approach is a happy compromise.

## What ?

This PR adds the `Carthage/Build` folder to `generated.rb` to blacklist it and its contents from PR diffs, etc.

## Why ?

While many developers [don't commit their `Carthage/Build` folder](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#using-submodules-for-dependencies), there are many developers and companies who do, due to the following reasons:

- Quicker build times in CI/CD (this is the top reason, usually)
- Ability for new developers to build immediately after cloning
- Many companies prefer keeping dependencies cloned to protect themselves from the day a project is ""gone""

The problem for pushing PRs that contain changes to dependencies is that they create an impossible-to-follow PR, as well as the fact the actual files changed by the developer don't get diffs as there are too many files.

This is an example from my own repo:
<img width=""992"" alt=""screen shot 2017-11-28 at 8 58 31 am"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/685609/33332907-565bec02-d41a-11e7-8211-5189e7661ae2.png"">

The actual code changes there were less than 20 lines, while the diff was very hard to read due to the binary changes in `Carthage/Build`.

_Note, I chose to not add `Carthage/Checkout` because the only time people will chose to commit that is if they're using submodules, in which case I believe it's useful to see hash changes in the diffs._ ",1449,True,en,2

To note:

- The compiler is being distributed as a Docker image, `linguist/grammars-compiler:latest` on Docker.io. The image is self-contained (duh) and includes all the dependencies, most notably NPM and the CSON parser it needs to run. `package.json` has been removed from this repository because eek.

- The new `script/grammars-compiler` is a thin wrapper over running the Docker image with the arguments you pass in.

- The main goal of the compiler is ensuring that all the grammars we add to Linguist are sensible and not malformed. This was _not_ the case previously. I've had to manually send PRs to many upstream repositories with different fixes for issues that the compiler has detected. Their corresponding submodules have been upgraded in https://github.com/github/linguist/commit/d08375d11bff726762b087bf0a1947f8903d74fd

- The compiler also normalizes the grammars into a fixed schema, removing superfluous keys and unifying content structures. This schema is serializable to JSON (like the old compiler) or to a Protobuf library, which we're going to start using internally.

- As it stands, this build is now green, although the compilation step is not fully ""clean"" yet. I'm going to open another issue with a list of outstanding issues in the existing grammars.

This PR adds the `Pods` folder to `generated.rb` to blacklist it and its contents from PR diffs, etc.

## Why ?

While many developers don't commit their `Pods` folder, there are many developers and companies who do, due to the following reasons:

1. Quicker build times in CI/CD _(this is the top reason, usually)_
2. Ability for new developers to build immediately after cloning
3. Many companies prefer keeping dependencies cloned to protect themselves from the day a project is ""gone""

The problem for pushing PRs that contain changes to dependencies is that they create an impossible-to-follow PR, as well as the fact the _actual files_ changed by the developer don't get diffs as there are too many files. 

Here's just a single example but we, as well as many other companies and devs I know, have this issue:

The problem can be recreated by creating a `.gitattributes` file that sets `linguist-language` to `true`, rather than a `String`.

So like this:

*.rb linguist-language

Okay, further digging around the corners of `languages.yml` revealed some other egregious cases of bogus ""markup"" languages, which my comment below describes in depth. I've updated the OP with a summary to recap what's changed:

* **ApacheConf** and **Nginx** configuration files recategorised from `markup` to `data`. The [latest ""trending"" Nginx repos](https://github.com/trending/nginx) reveals no physics-defying typesetting logic that can explain how a list of server variables controls the flow of typography (I've seriously been spending too much time in `troff`, honestly...)

* **Web Ontology Language** was tagged as `markup`, presumably by a submitter who was mislead by the connection to XML (possibly before XML was deemed to be data-typed, rather than real markup).

* **Eagle** CAD files specify PCB drawing data for the Eagle CAD suite. See https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3743#issuecomment-319643063 for long-winded rationale and too many tangential anecdotes.

* **XPages** was a dead giveaway with its only two file-extensions being `.xsp-config` and `.xsp.metadata`. Didn't take much research to figure out they're just [XML-based configuration files](https://github.com/jesse-gallagher/Raidomatic/blob/6a3b28ebcb591f6dfb8d9eb8dd3f7b1c18035401/forums/CustomControls/DateTime.xsp-config) for a [web application framework](http://xpages.info/XPagesHome.nsf/Home.xsp) named ""XPages"". On the plus side, I also added XML highlighting for it, so at least its data [will look nicer now](https://github-lightshow.herokuapp.com/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&scope=text.xml&grammar_url=&grammar_text=&code_source=from-url&code_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjesse-gallagher%2FRaidomatic%2Fblob%2F6a3b28ebcb591f6dfb8d9eb8dd3f7b1c18035401%2Fforums%2FCustomControls%2FDateTime.xsp-config&code=). =)

* **Pure Data** was only investigated for laughs because of the name, which looked ironic juxtaposed to a `type` of `programming`. After looking it up though, it turns out that the... frikkin' language really is [""pure data""](https://github.com/halfbyte/PureDataLibrary/blob/master/zerhacker.pd). I'll quote [PD's FAQ here](https://puredata.info/docs/faq/whatispd):

	> **Q:** _""What Is Pd?""_
	> **A:** `Pd` stands for `Pure Data.` Pd is a real-time software system for live musical and multimedia performances. It is in active development by Miller Puckette, and perhaps others. The system is unfinished, but quite usable for sophisticated projects.

	And the gloss on [PD's homepage](https://puredata.info/) makes it pretty obvious it isn't even programmer-related:

	> Pure Data is an open source visual programming environment [ … ] Pd enables musicians, visual artists, performers, researchers, and developers to create software graphically without writing lines of code. Pd can be used to process and generate sound, video, 2D/3D graphics, and interface sensors, input devices, and MIDI

	One look at the [sort of stuff](https://github.com/breedx2/pure-data/blob/master/abstractions/ctable.pd) that `.pd` files contain, and you know it's not been hand-written... Though to be fair, this misclassification was added [in the same commit](https://github.com/github/linguist/commit/8f46cd07487b6c5ce034ef7a9a3e19f999914513#diff-3552b1a64ad2071983c4d91349075c75R621) that Linguist's first two language-types were defined: which were limited to `Programming` and `Markup`. Guess it escaped notice and remained unnoticed for ~6 years.

### Original post that started this search:

@goodmind pointed out a confusing oddity in #3740:

> I looked at Protobuf and it has `type: markup` but initially I thought that this type should be used for HTML-like languages only and not RPC languages like Protobuf. (markup type is very misleading at first)

He's right. My understanding of Protobuf is that it's used for defining APIs, not marking up presentational content.

The current `type` classification for Protocol Buffer was added by @qqshfox in February 2013 (#392). I'd say Linguist's handling of language-types has become much more refined in the years since, but I feel I should ping @qqshfox to ask if he feels `markup` would still be a more suitable descriptor for Protocol Buffer?

My exposure with Protobuf is rather minimal, but I was actually reading about it recently after submitting [`google/fonts#1094`](https://github.com/google/fonts/pull/1094), and then wondering about the missing syntax highlighting for its ""text-based component"".",4475,False,en,0

What's **Gerber**, you ask? Well, if you haven't figured out from the name that it's [the de facto standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format) for PCB imaging formats, then I don't know what else to tell you. In all seriousness, the format has been standardised since at least 1998, and with more file extension schizophrenia than Markdown AND Roff together.

I wouldn't have expected such a format to have a widespread presence on GitHub, and... well, I was wrong:

You see now why I already hate this format.

Despite the ridiculous number of extensions, there's thankfully very little conflict with existing file formats. Most of the clashes are with binary files, which Linguist would skip anyway. You can see the sorted result of each filetype search in the aforementioned sample links.

* [`.brd` breakdown](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/blob/brd/breakdown.log)

## Notes
* KiCad formats are `data` formats, not `programming` languages. I'm not sure why @pchaigno [chose the latter](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/2309/files#diff-3552b1a64ad2071983c4d91349075c75R1566) in #2309 / #2187, but these formats are essentially just lists of coordinates, property lists, and object descriptions. XML has more in common with programming languages than these do.

* A considerable number of `sch` search results were [Scheme files](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/blob/sch/urls-lang%3Dscheme.log). I ran an [additional search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Asch+define&type=Code) to gauge the extension's usage better, and concluded that it's common enough to include it as a recognised Scheme extension. There were numerous Racket files as well, but I don't know the difference between Scheme and Racket, so I left the latter as-is.

* Sample files were sourced from faffing around with vanilla [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) and [gEDA-gaf](http://www.geda-project.org/) installations, and me clicking anything that looked like a drawing tool. Needless to say, I couldn't find any samples released under a clear permissive license, so I hacked together my own.

* Scheme sample [`sboyer.sch`](https://github.com/shymega/guile/blob/cfe2279fea0987291bd772c769a204ca33e656b9/gc-benchmarks/larceny/sboyer.sch) released to the public domain ([source confirmed here](http://www.larcenists.org/R6src/sboyer.sch)).

Fundamentally, all three formats are the same for our purposes: they share the same file-extension and perceivable syntax, so I haven't bothered adding `*.acfm` and `*.amfm` files as associated extensions. Not that there [even](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Aamfm+NOT+nothack&type=Code) [are](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Aacfm+NOT+nothack&type=Code), anyway.

### In-the-wild usage

Scrape and logs stashed in the silo, as per usual: [`Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/tree/afm`](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/tree/afm). Nearly [269,000](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Aafm+NOT+nothack&type=Code) results in-the-wild, most of them duplicates. Which doesn't surprise me, considering a good deal of those results point to GhostScript forks/mirrors. GhostScript (the most popular free implementation of Adobe PostScript) distributes free versions of the base 35 PDF fonts in [several formats](http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=urw-core35-fonts.git;a=commit;h=1f28a6fcd2176256a995db907d9ffe6e1b9b83e9), which includes AFM files.


### Origin of samples

Both of the samples I added were converted from TTF files sourced from [`google/fonts`](https://github.com/google/fonts), both released under Apache-friendly licenses:

* `SpecialElite.afm` -> https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/8839397/apache/specialelite
* `OpenSansCondensed-Bold.afm` -> https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/44438ae/apache/opensanscondensed

To be honest, I really don't think it matters, though. AFM files don't contain any glyph information: just the width and heights, spacing adjustments, et al. I erred on the side of caution anyway. GhostScript's fonts are released under the [GNU Affero License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html), so... suffice to say that was a no-go.

He's right, and now that I think about it, I'm not entirely sure where the colour green came from. Everything in the language's branding uses either purple or dark blue, so that's obviously much more representative of the language than, well, `rgb(41,181,68)`.

A lot has happened in those years, including several new releases of Perl 5, and a little thing we call **Perl 6**. That 6 is deceptive though; **Perl 6** is really a “kid sister” language to Perl 5, and not just a major update to Perl 5 that version numbers have trained you to expect.

Use of these files has spread substantially since the working group announced [cross-browser consensus](http://webassembly.org/roadmap/).

* [`.wat`](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/tree/wat) 25,812 files

The `wast` results were very promising; virtually every result was WebAssembly. The `wat` search, while offering a healthy amount of WebAssembly too, tossed up an unusual number of Makefiles and other junk related to ""Watcom"" (probably [Watcom C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcom_C/C%2B%2B0)…?) The biggest offender here are `makefile.wat` files, [which as you'll see](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/tree/wat/files/Makefile), add up to nearly 800 unique variations from collated results (that's with duplicates removed).

This PR merges the heuristics used for matching `.t` files on GitHub, but also applies a few other enhancements I made along the way:

1. **Perl 6 is now checked before Perl 5**  
Both languages understand `use strict;`, but the pragma is less likely to surface in the former. [According to the docs](https://docs.perl6.org/language/5to6-nutshell#Pragmas), Perl 6 enables strict mode by default, making the `use strict;` pragma redundant. Conversely, Perl 5 has strict mode *off* by default for compatibility reasons only - but every Perl programmer knows to enable strict-mode (and warnings) before starting work on any halfway-serious program.

2. **Multiple blanks are now checked, instead of matching a single space**  
`/use strict/` won't catch pragmas that use tabs, or have multiple spaces between each word. Newlines are even permitted too: the following chunk is valid Perl:
	~~~perl
	use

	strict;

	use
		v5.24.0;
	~~~

3. **Turing's heuristic now looks for `:=` instead of `:`**  
The tests failed because a [Terra file](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/9b8b39f/samples/Terra/arith.t#L49) was misclassified as Turing. I realised a pattern like `var abc : xyz` is bound to surface in other languages, so I changed it to match `var abc := xyz` instead. `:=` wasn't mentioned anywhere in [Terra's language reference](http://terralang.org/getting-started.html#the-terra-language), so I'm guessing it won't occur there.

### Other observations

* **Semicolons are valid Turing**  
In #3546, I wondered if the original Turing/Perl heuristic could be refined to check for trailing semicolons (since Turing doesn't use the). I installed and ran [Open Turing](http://tristan.hume.ca/openturing/), and it evaluated `put 2 * 8;` perfectly fine. I guess they're legal characters, but ignored. Noting this for future reference if needed.

* **Many of the other heuristics could be (micro-)optimised**  
There're numerous capturing groups that aren't referred to by back-references, which requires a little extra overhead at runtime (since the regex engine needs to retain references to captured substrings). Using `(?:…)` instead of `(…)` is generally best practice when referencing the capture isn't needed.
Granted, the performance boost is only minimal, but if this code has to check millions of files, well... I'd wring every drop of performance I could get.

* **Our heuristics are making naive assumptions about whitespace**  
Going back to point \#2 above, it's likely that some heuristics aren't matching files they should be because the subject's source code contains multiple whitespace characters.",2745,True,en,0

On closer inspection, it makes more sense to return early in `Classifier.classify` if no languages have been supplied as by not doing so, we unnecessarily tokenise the data that won't be used when it comes to scoring further down in the method.

This makes a significant difference in the time it takes to perform against the problematic file, before the early return:

This PR adds `source.terraform` and uses it instead of ruby for `.hcl` and `.tf`. I've also expanded the `example.tf` to demonstrate some more of the HCL language features, which might be useful for testing syntax highlighting improvements going forward. It's a reasonably popular language - TF has ~47k results on [Github search](

**GN** (_""Generate Ninja""_) is a companion project to the [Ninja build system](https://ninja-build.org/) which generates `.ninja` files using a lightweight configuration language. Its syntax is [reminiscent of Python](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v8/v8/f8cbe2768cc88cb40e24c929fb28965bfb0ca6fe/BUILD.gn), but such similarities are purely superficial. GN's language is purposefully stripped-down to be as predictable as possible. To quote their [design philosophy](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/tools/gn/docs/language.md#Design-philosophy):

> Writing build files should not be a creative endeavour. Ideally two people should produce the same buildfile given the same requirements. There should be no flexibility unless it's absolutely needed. As many things should be fatal errors as possible.

For this reason, I've classed GN as a `data`-type language, albeit tentatively.

Usage on GitHub
---------------
GN uses the extensions `.gn` and `.gni`, both of which have considerable in-the-wild usage:

* [`.gn`](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/tree/gn): [96,823 results](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Agn+NOT+nothack&type=Code)
* [`.gni`](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/tree/gni) [14,494 results](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Agni+NOT+nothack&type=Code)


Related additions
-----------------
I've also added support for `.gypi` and `.gclient` files as Python types, which have considerable use across GitHub:

* [`.gypi` extension](https://github.com/search?p=3&q=extension%3Agypi+NOT+nothack&type=Code): 309,927 files
* [`.gclient` filename](https://github.com/search?q=filename%3A.gclient+NOT+nothack&type=Code): 4,078 files

`.gypi` files are GYP includes. `.gclient` is a config script written in Python used by Google's `depot_tools` for checking out projects. [From their docs](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools#TOC-gclient):

> * `.gclient` and `DEPS` are python scripts, you can hack in easily or add additional configuration data.  
> …
> * __.gclient file:__ It's the master file. It is, in fact, a python script.

I thought to add `DEPS` as well, but realised the filename was generic enough to cause problems if it were added as a Python type. Seeing [unrelated results](https://github.com/stiq/symfonyblog/blob/e23c8d2669363172e0ce7416586e0033b43c0a9f/deps) on the first [search-result page](https://github.com/search?q=filename%3ADEPS+NOT+nothack&type=Code) confirmed that would've been a bad idea.

Half of these are GPL2.1-licensed files from Coq's standard distribution. They escaped notice because our samples had the copyright headers removed (which, needless to say, is *not* a very nice thing):

The remaining files were taken from an [online course by Software Foundations](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/), which is released under the MIT license. You can verify this by downloading it and consulting `LICENSE` in the tarball's root directory.

[`Basics.v`](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/7b6caa0f6c7603aabb5e6ed657e24aaddbeafc78/samples/Coq/Basics.v) is mostly composed of material from the aforementioned course, but I also noticed code chunks in there which weren't used in the original source. I've removed it to be safe, since the licensing wasn't clear.

I also added a test to check that all language ids are unsigned 32bit integers.
Supersedes #3247. Fixes #3211.

The `language_id` is the SHA256 hash of the language name modulo-ed to an unsigned 32bit integer:

``` ruby
Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(language).to_i(16) % (2**30 - 1)
```

Therefore, as long as the language names are different, the probability of collision is of 0.009561175% if we reach 1,000 languages [1]. This is important as we might not always be able to detect a collision. For instance, if a language entry is removed from Linguist and we later add a new language id that conflicts with the older removed language, the tests won't help detecting it.

The choice to generate the language id from the language name is based on the idea that we probably want two entries with the same name to have the same id (if we remove a language and add it back later). If we do not want that, I could simply change the pull request to generate random ids, which would give us the same collision probability.

I think it's important that we discuss this thoroughly, as we probably want to avoid changing the strategy to generate language ids too often (it's already our second system :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: ).

These files are most certainly not JavaScript... the only thing distinguishing them from JSON is support for JS comments.

Because many of them _do_ contain comments, using the JSON grammar to provide highlighting will produce a lot of incorrect, messy highlighting. I've added a separate entry to group them under JSON, but use the JavaScript grammar for highlighting.

Linguist's submodules have a healthy abundance of Sublime configs already, so the samples I added were simply copied from `vendor/grammars`.

With @keplersj's help, I was able to collate a list of normative references for each documented format. Some were undocumented altogether; presumably deprecated filenames supported in older versions.

This grammar wasn't mine to begin with, BTW... it was transferred to me by its author, who originally ported it from a TextMate bundle (which is also what the current grammar was derived from, I believe).

I also [wrote a script](https://github.com/Alhadis/language-viml/blob/master/tools/update-keywords.js) to keep the grammar updated with keywords pulled from Vim's [own syntax file](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/syntax/vim.vim) for Vimscript. So it'll stay nice and updated. =)

@larsbrinkhoff Regarding the `.eld` extension, I don't think [there's enough](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Aeld+NOT+nothack&type=Code) usage on GitHub to warrant listing it.

## Questions
1. [`abbrev_defs`](https://github.com/search?q=filename%3A.abbrev_defs+NOT+nothack&type=Code) is another auto-generated file used by Emacs to store user abbreviations (which is like an autocomplete feature, I'm guessing). ~1,342 results probably aren't enough to add the filename to Linguist, I'm guessing, but these files are most definitely auto-generated. ~~Should it be added as such?~~<br>**UPDATE:** Added as both `.abbrev_defs` and `abbrev_defs`.
2. Emacs has a package manager called **ELPA** ([Emacs Lisp Package Archive](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA_)), which installs Lisp packages to one's user directory: `~/.emacs.d/elpa/`. Users who host their dotfiles on GitHub [mightn't always](https://github.com/haipengliu/my.emacs.d/tree/796abad212e127f99a3f6fddc1e1873681ea859c/elpa) remember to add `elpa/` to `.gitignore`, so this should be marked as a vendored path.<br><br>I don't know how many users on GitHub _have_ added these packages to their repository, however, because I don't know how to search files by their containing directory's name, as opposed to their filenames only. Somebody help?

This PR adds:
- A `language_id` field to every language known to Linguist (all 422 of them)
- A script (`script/set-language-ids`) to add (and update) `language_id` fields
- Some tests to raise hell if anyone ever tries to change these.

**Rationale**

Currently we can't update a language name as the language name (e.g. `Ruby`) is actually _in_ the GitHub search index. This PR adds a `language_id` field to all of the languages defined in `languages.yml` so that this field can be used in the search indexes instead. We'll then add some view-layer transformations to turn the `language_id` back into a language (with human-readable name) on GitHub.com.

Please note, once this is merged (and shipped on GitHub), modifying these `language_id` fields would be very bad news unless we were planning on re-indexing all of the code on GitHub. As such, I've added some tests for the expected `language_id` value for a few known languages. There's also a `script/set-language-ids --update` which is what contributors adding a new language should use to set the `language_id` value for their new language.

I'd like to get this merged :soon: as we're looking at doing a major re-index of GitHub shortly. That said, a review from any/all of @pchaigno @larsbrinkhoff @Alhadis would be very welcome.

vim: noexpandtab: ft=javascript:

[Version-specific modelines](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#modeline-version) were also unaccounted for:

vim<600: set ft=javascript:                    # <  Vim 6.0

I found backslashes weren't considered either, though this is probably a non-issue. I fixed it anyway:

```
vim: titlestring=foo\ ft=notperl ft=javascript:
```

Preceding whitespace isn't being checked, either. Vim's [documentation states](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#modeline) that a preceding blank is required before `vim` or `vi`:

> The white space before `{vi:|vim:|ex:}` is required.  This minimises the chance that a normal word like `lex:` is caught.  There is one exception: `vi:` and `vim:` can also be at the start of the line (for compatibility with version 3.0). Using `ex:` at the start of the line will be ignored (this could be short for `example:`).

Which means something like this isn't a valid modeline, yet Linguist detects it as one:

```
novim: ft=perl

And if there's ANY language whose colours deserve to retain their tonal integrity, it's the language that pretty much pioneered the whole world of desktop publishing.

The conflicting colours (Scala and, uhm, ""Red"") were pushed apart somewhat. Red was made redder, and Scala was given a desaturated darker shade of red. Scala's change is a bit more noticeable than Red's, but it was [too close to HTML's colour](https://github.com/guardian/membership-frontend) anyway.

You can probably see what I mean.
#### Extra extensions

I've added a few extra file extensions for Roff:
- [`.tmac`](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Atmac+NOT+nothack&type=Code): Troff macros. Refers to the standard macro bundles distributed with Groff and Troff.
- [`mmn`](https://github.com/search?q=filename%3Ammn+NOT+nothack&type=Code), [`mmt`](https://github.com/search?q=filename%3Ammt+NOT+nothack&type=Code): Nroff and Troff macros, respectively.
  Mostly distributed with the Plan 9 OS, but possibly in other distros too.
#### Sample licenses

The `.tmac` sample is from GNU Groff, but it's not GPL-licensed.  
To quote [**groff_man**(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man.7.html#FILES):

> It is written in classic troff, and released for free re-use, and not copylefted; manual  page  authors  concerned about portability to legacy Unix systems are encouraged to copy these definitions into their pages, and maintainers of troff or its workalikes are encouraged to re-use them.

I'm not sure about the license of Plan 9, but I'm assuming that _is_ copylefted. Hence the reason I didn't include sample files for `mmn` and `mmt` (unless their contents don't count?)
## RUNOFF

The grandfather of _roff_, and indeed of all modern typesetting. I've added it primarily to help disambiguate the `.rno` extension, which is also used by some manpages.

Considering the antiquity of RUNOFF, it's not surprising the language doesn't command a widespread presence on GitHub. You're looking at something developed in the early 1960s... that's even older than the moon landing. However, at least two extensions see modest (albeit limited) distribution:
- [`.rno`](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Arno+NOT+nothack&type=Code) (980 results)
- [`.rnh`](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Arnh+NOT+nothack&type=Code) (574 results)

RUNOFF used [several other](https://github.com/Alhadis/language-roff/blob/master/grammars/runoff.cson#L1-L17) file extensions too, especially `.run`. I've left those out, for obvious reasons. My main motivation is to separate RUNOFF's classification from Roff's. The two languages are only superficially similar.
#### Colour choice

I chose a rusty brown to represent the language, the colour of a bronze typewriter.

Turing and Perl6 both use different styles of line-comments (`%` versus `#`, respectively), so the heuristic was easy to add. [Surprisingly](http://i.imgur.com/9Fxm1eT.png), I managed to get Perl6 running to test if `%` was invalid syntax at the start of a line. A glaring error message confirmed that it was indeed invalid syntax:

Turing's heuristic also checks for `var {name} : {type}`-like patterns, where `{name}` and `{type}` are sequences of word-characters (`\w`).

Imagine there's a file named `hashbang` written to run under GNU APL:

``` shell

```
hashbang: 8 lines (7 sloc)

  mime type: text/plain
  language:  
```

`.lock` is used for many purposes, the most common of which being lock files. JSON does not appear to be a common format for `.lock` files.

This PR removes `.lock` from the JSON language, and updates a test and sample for `composer.lock`, which remains JSON (which itself was added in #790)

I was hesitant to propose switching grammars, because the one being switched to is mine, [which I wrote for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-apl).

Anyway... the grammar being used to highlight APL on this site is... okay, but it leaves out a lot. It highlights symbols only, ignoring their context. For example, `⍵` and `⍶` only have significance when used inside the body of a user-defined function or operator, but the grammar highlights them irrespective of where they're used.

Its coverage of the APL alphabet is also incomplete:
- [Current grammar](https://github-lightshow.herokuapp.com/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&scope=source.apl&grammar_url=&grammar_text=&code_source=from-url&code_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAlhadis%2Flanguage-apl%2Fmaster%2Ftests%2Fsymbols.apl&code=text+%E2%86%90+%E2%8E%95INP+%22END-OF-HTML%22%0D%0A%3Cheader+id%3D%22top%22%3E%E2%8D%9D+Heading+%E2%8D%9D%3C%2Fheader%3E%0D%0Aasfdwger%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D+END-OF-HTML+%3D%3D%3D%3Dq3ewrfd..%3F)

**NOTE:** The symbols categorised as ""Unused"" in the above example are defined by the APL standard, but aren't recognised as functions in many interpreters. They may be implemented as functions by interpreters I'm unfamiliar with, though.
## Comparisons

Note the comments in the rendered examples aren't related to the comparisons being made: they're simply reminiscent of the [fixture I wrote](https://github-lightshow.herokuapp.com/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&scope=from-url&grammar_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpastebin.com%2Fraw%2F5X7kA5D0&grammar_text=&code_source=from-url&code_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAlhadis%2Flanguage-apl%2Fmaster%2Ftests%2Fvarious.apl&code=) while testing the grammar.
### 1. Variable highlighting / Scientific notation

The current grammar doesn't properly highlight variables which contain numbers, and doesn't recognise exponential notation, either:

<a href=""https://github-lightshow.herokuapp.com/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&scope=from-url&grammar_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpastebin.com%2Fraw%2F5X7kA5D0&grammar_text=&code_source=from-text&code_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAlhadis%2Flanguage-apl%2Fmaster%2Ftests%2Fvarious.apl&code=%E2%8D%9D+Scientific+notation%0D%0A29.e%C2%AF2%0D%0A29e2%0D%0A2.9e2%0D%0A2.9e%C2%AF2%0D%0A%0D%0A%E2%8D%9D+NOT+scientific+notation%0D%0A29e-2%0D%0A2.+DModel%0D%0A2.5DModel%0D%0A3DModel%0D%0A33.333%28DModel%29%0D%0AAnother3DModel+%E2%86%90+Mesh""><img width=""497"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2346707/14310322/ab4977c2-fc24-11e5-817a-6256b9921786.png"" alt=""Figure 1"" /></a>

**Note:** `""3dModel""` would be interpreted in APL as two values: a literal number, followed by a named reference. Equivalent to `[3, dModel]` in JavaScript.
### 2. Support for `)SYSTEM` or `]USER` commands

The new grammar properly recognises interpreter-specific command sequences:

<a href=""https://github-lightshow.herokuapp.com/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&scope=from-url&grammar_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpastebin.com%2Fraw%2F5X7kA5D0&grammar_text=&code_source=from-text&code_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAlhadis%2Flanguage-apl%2Fmaster%2Ftests%2Fvarious.apl&code=%E2%8D%9D+Space+before+comments%0D%0A%5Dsampleb+xyz+-TZ%3D123+%E2%8D%9DCOMMENT%0D%0A%5DCOLOR+OFF%0D%0A%29LIST+vars+%E2%8D%9DCOMMENT%0D%0A%0D%0A%E2%8D%9D+No+whitespace%0D%0A%5Dsampleb+23+-TZ%3D123%E2%8D%9DCOMMENT%0D%0A%5DCOLOR+OFF%0D%0A%29LIST+vars%E2%8D%9DCOMMENT""><img width=""576"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2346707/14310326/b0aae5b6-fc24-11e5-865f-45b48e552d43.png"" alt=""Figure 2"" /></a>
### 3. Function/operator highlighting

The current grammar has virtually no recognition of user-defined functions or operators. Conversely, the new grammar does - and also highlights invalid arguments/operands:

<a href=""https://github-lightshow.herokuapp.com/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&scope=from-url&grammar_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpastebin.com%2Fraw%2F5X7kA5D0&grammar_text=&code_source=from-text&code_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAlhadis%2Flanguage-apl%2Fmaster%2Ftests%2Fvarious.apl&code=%E2%8D%9D+Operator%3A+Valid%0D%0A%E2%88%87R+%E2%86%90+X+%28LOP+OPERATOR+ROP%29+Y+%3BA%3BB%0D%0A%09R+%E2%86%90+X+%2B+Y%0D%0A%E2%88%87%0D%0A%0D%0A%E2%88%87R+%E2%86%90+%28LOP+OPERATOR+ROP%29+X+%3BA%3BB%0D%0A%09R+%E2%86%90+X+%2B+Y%0D%0A%E2%88%87%0D%0A%0D%0A%E2%8D%9D+Operator%3A+Invalid%0D%0A%E2%88%87R+%E2%86%90+X+%28LOP+OPERATOR+ROP%29+Y+%3BA%3BB%3B%0D%0A%09R+%E2%86%90+X+%2B+Y%0D%0A%E2%88%87%0D%0A%0D%0A%E2%88%87R+%E2%86%90+%28LOP+OPERATOR+ROP%29+Y+Invalid%3BB%3BR%3BU%3BH%3B%0D%0A%09R+%E2%86%90+X+%2B+Y%0D%0A%E2%88%87%0D%0A%0D%0A%E2%8D%9D+Axis+operators%0D%0A%E2%88%87+FUNCTION+%5BAXIS%5D+right%3BX%3BY%0D%0A%09%E2%8E%95%E2%86%90input%0D%0A%E2%88%87%0D%0A%0D%0A%E2%88%87+left+FUNCTION%5BAXIS+INVALID%5D+right%0D%0A%09%E2%8E%95%E2%86%90input%0D%0A%E2%88%87""><img width=""670"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2346707/14310331/b3b70960-fc24-11e5-92fb-3f6d4ab82ec2.png"" alt=""Figure 3"" /></a>

You'll need to know APL to understand why they're being marked as invalid, but [here's a basic primer](http://help.dyalog.com/14.1/Content/Language/Defined%20Functions%20and%20Operators/Model%20Syntax.htm).
### 4. EOF sequences

GNU APL allows arbitrary content to be added after the terminating `)OFF` or `]NEXTFILE` commands, similar to Perl's `__END__` sequence. Anything following an EOF command shouldn't be highlighted as APL:

This is often used to include [licensing info](https://github.com/Alhadis/language-apl/blob/master/tests/toronto-toolkit.apl#L10350) or additional documentation with APL scripts.
### 5. Heredocs

GNU APL also allows [heredocs](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%E2%8E%95INP+language%3AAPL&type=Code&ref=searchresults) with arbitrary terminators, ideal for embedding HTML in CGI scripts:

The [ISC license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) is a permissive, OSI-approved free software license that's functionally identical to the MIT/Expat license. The only ""difference"" is the ISC license excludes legal clauses that're already covered by the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention).

The ISC license is [recommended by OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html), and is also the default license type of newly-created NPM modules. The terseness and straightforwardness of the clauses make it (in my opinion, anyway) a preferable alternative to the decidedly long-winded MIT license.

---

**TL;DR:** [Same](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/isc/) [shit](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), different TLA.

Basically, I was surprised when Linguist's tests rejected the addition of a grammar addition, stating that ISC wasn't on the license whitelist.

## The heuristic

I don't know a single word of Erlang, but it appears that `.es` files (""Erlang scripts"") are an interpreted form of the language which requires an author to define a routine named `main` in the source. From the [official documentation](http://erlang.org/doc/man/escript.html):

> An Erlang script file must always contain the function **main/1**. When the script is run, the `main/1` function will be called with a list of strings representing the arguments given to the script (not changed or interpreted in any way).

I deduced that Erlang scripts could be identified by `main([]) ->`, which is also illegal JavaScript.

I extended the heuristic to check for lines beginning with `%%`. While Erlang uses `%` to initiate a comment, the doubled form is also abundant. It's also the required form of passing arguments to the emulator. To quote the docs I linked to above:

> Such an argument line must start with `%%!` and the rest of the line will interpreted as arguments to the emulator.

While it's unlikely a JavaScript file would have a modulus operator at the start of a line, it isn't invalid syntax. For instance, this is legal JavaScript (albeit really weird):

``` js
let a = 2
% 1;
```
## Results

Not surprisingly, most search results for `.es` yielded files [localised](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Heuristics/tree/es/fixtures/Unrelated/Espa%C3%B1ol) in Spanish (esto es un buen lingüista, jajaja). All but two of the ~2,777 files collected from [search results](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Aes+NOT+nothack&type=Code) were [correctly identified](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Heuristics/blob/es/results.txt) as either ECMAScript or Erlang:

**[App.2.es:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/embedthis/ejscript/f85405f5c25a3335a9bf4f4a249e5f3eaf225081/samples/web/mvc-blog/blog/src/App.es)**

``` js
module App {
}
```

**[locale.js.es:](https://github.com/delsovalle/prometeus/blob/d79577ff8aee2b14053e3be9f18497363fe37d30/synoman/phpsrc/web/js/locale.js.es)**

```
_={""a"":""No se encuentra la página"",""b"":""Lo sentimos, no se encuentra la página que está buscando."",""c"":""Anterior""};
```

I don't think those two edge cases are really worth the trouble of bloating the heuristic for. For a start, the first one isn't even real JavaScript (but a mutated superset called [Embedthis Ejscript](https://github.com/embedthis/ejscript/)). As for the second, well, I'd be lying if I said I see something like that every day.

Fixes #2789. In vim there are two forms of modelines:

```
[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|ex:}[white]{options}
examples: 'vim: syntax=perl', 'ex: filetype=ruby'
```

-and-

```
[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:}[white]se[t] {options}:[text]
examples: 'vim set syntax=perl:', 'Vim: se ft=ruby:'
```

As you can see, there are many combinations. These changes should allow most combinations to be used. The two most important additions are the use of the keyword 'syntax', as well as the addition of the first form (you now no longer need to use the keyword 'set' with a colon at the end). The use of first form with 'syntax' is [very, very common across GitHub](https://github.com/search?l=ruby&q=vim%3A+syntax%3D&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)

This pull request adds a new heuristic rule for `.pod` files. If they contain any Pod syntax they are directly classified as Pod files. Files without any Pod syntax are classified as Perl files.
- `.pod` files without any Pod syntax will be highlighted as Perl and counted in statistics.
- Other `.pod` files will be rendered via Markup and won't be counted in statistics.

An alternate solution would be to recognize all `.pod` files as Pod (since they're not supposed to contain executable code but only documentation).

Scenes written in this language are traditionally stored across multiple files, with a main file carrying the `.pov` extension referencing multiple _include files_ carrying the `.inc` extension.

Repositories using POV-Ray SDL already number in the tens of thousands for both extensions:

https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mesh+OR+mesh2+OR+sphere+OR+object+OR+texture+extension%3Apov&type=Code&ref=searchresults

https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mesh+OR+mesh2+OR+sphere+OR+object+OR+texture+extension%3Ainc&type=Code&ref=searchresults

The use of the `.pov` extension for POV-Ray SDL is currently uncontested.

The use of the `.inc` extension for POV-Ray SDL clashes with its use for the following languages:
- Assembly
- C++
- HTML
- Makefile (`Makefile.inc`)
- PHP
- Pascal
- SQL
- SourcePawn

From a cursory examination of random files reported by the above query for `.inc` files, about 3.0 million POV-Ray SDL files are currently misclassified as PHP, and a further 0.1 million as C++. Misclassification as SourcePawn, Assembly, Pascal or HTML can be demonstrated, but is rare.

2749,7,12,0,Externals,Alhadis,2015-12-08T13:04:13Z,186,1,9,10,"This PR adds support for MAXScript, the built-in scripting language for [3ds Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max).
## Usage

MAXScript isn't exactly kicking JavaScript in terms of popularity, to say the least, but there's enough in-the-wild usage to warrant the language's inclusion on GitHub:
- [extension:ms fn](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Ams+fn) (~6,610 results)
- [extension:ms function](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Ams+function) (~13,470 results)

[ScriptSpot](http://www.scriptspot.com/) has been a well-known and popular resource for MAXScripts since at [least 2000](http://www.scriptspot.com/3ds-max/plugins/maxscribe), although the site's maintenance appears to have declined sharply in recent years. It's probably as good a time as any to introduce formal support for MAXScript on GitHub, which may encourage more MAXScripters to upload/share their work.
## Heuristic modifications

MAXScript already offers a `move` function, so we can't rely on the current heuristic of identifying GAS by the presence of a `move` command.

My initial approach was to check for Assembly-like statements like the following, since it'd be a syntax error in MAXScript:

```
.LGCOMMAND
    .now
    .return
```

However, because of MAXScript's fluidity, it's unreasonable to assume lengthy statements won't be broken across multiple lines:

```
    value = colossal_plugin_struct_thing \
        .calculate this mumbo:#jumbo

    -- That has the same effect as writing this:
    value = colossal_plugin_struct_thing.calculate this mumbo:#jumbo
```

In other words, simply checking `\n\s*\.[A-Za-z]` isn't good enough; we need to account for things like escaped line-breaks and string literals/comments:

``` rb
data.gsub(/""([^\\""]|\\.)*""|'([^\\']|\\.)*'/, """").gsub(/\\\s*(?:--.*)?\n/, ""\n"")
```

This might be slight overkill, but it irons out any potential for misclassification.
## Performance

I took the time to analyse the performance of different heuristics when run against a [repository of considerable size](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Heuristics-MS) (15,609 files, 1.4 GiBs). I've averaged the speed results below, but the full stats can be [viewed here](http://pastebin.com/EmLwT0xU) for anybody who's curious.
### Original/Current `.ms` Heuristic

```
/((^|\s)move?[. ])|\.(include|globa?l)\s/.match(data)

Average speed (10 runs):
    real    39.8s
    user    38.9869s
    sys     0.8023s
```
### Amended Heuristic

```
/(?<!\S)\.(include|globa?l)\s/.match(data) || 
    /(?<!\/\*)(\A|\n)\s*\.[A-Za-z]/.match(data.gsub(/""([^\\""]|\\.)*""|'([^\\']|\\.)*'|\\\s*(?:--.*)?\n/, """"))

Average speed (10 runs):
    real    41.3077s
    user    40.3206s
    sys     0.9744s
```
### Earlier variations:

These are potentially slightly faster, but offer a little less accuracy:

```
/(?<!\S)\.(include|globa?l)\s/.match(data) ||
    /(?<!\/\*)(\A|\n)\s*\.[A-Za-z]/.match(data.sub(/""([^\\""]|\\.)*""|'([^\\']|\\.)*'/, """"))

Average speed (10 runs):
    real    40.0s
    user    39.1899s
    sys     0.7947s
```

```
/(?<!\S)\.(include|globa?l)\s/.match(data) || /(?<!\/\*)(\A|\n)\s*\.[A-Za-z]/.match(data)

Average speed (10 runs):

The extensions `ddl` and `prc` both with an existing mapping to `SQL`, but I feel should also have cases where they are mapped to PL/SQL - it seems `create`, `replace` for example aren't syntax highlighted in the phrase `create or replace`. Example case - https://github.com/gordynor/Demo/blob/0ddb72599c26b935d5731cf2d5e9680f6ac73c5a/sql/test.prc
- ddl - 417 entries [[9](https://github.com/search?p=41&q=%22create+or+replace%22+extension%3Addl&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)].
- prc - 21777 entries [[10](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22create+or+replace%22+extension%3Aprc&type=Code&ref=searchresults)]

I added opposing samples in the samples directory for `prc` and `ddl` which contain a `create or replace` statement. https://github.com/tschf/linguist/tree/master/samples/PLSQL. Is this sufficient?

The other extension added to the grammar was `dml`. Upon searching with phrases like `create or replace` (only 5 code files - expected to be low, since it's DML) or `insert into` (still only 99 code entries). As such left this one out.

The contributing guide states that extensions should be in use in hundreds of repositories, so I'm not sure if the above analysis means the majority of these extensions fail that requirement or not.

Also, the contributing guidelines mention about testing the performance of the Bayesian classifier. I wasn't really sure where to begin with this?

2568,6,15,3,Internals,benbalter,2015-08-20T19:42:50Z,83,57,3,1,"This pull requests updates the grammars test to lean on Licensee to do much of the license-detection heavy lifting. Specifically:
1. Look to Licensee first to see if it can detect a license
2. If licensee couldn't detect the license, but found a license file, use [Licensee's more nuanced license file detection](https://github.com/benbalter/licensee/blob/master/lib/licensee/project.rb#L37-L50), passing the license file to the existing license detection
3. If all else fails, look to the readme

Beyond the updated logic, rather than break things out into `:unlicensed` and `:unrecognized`, the test now contains an explicit whitelist of approved licenses which it compare the detected license, if any against. This allows for more descriptive failure messages (e.g., `the submodule FOO is licensed under the XYZ license, but the XYZ license isn't an approved license`). 

To implement this, I added a private `submodule_license` method to separate the license detection logic, and a private `submodule_licenses` which returns a hash containing each submodule and its license.

The `#import` (as opposed to `#include`) directive is used by both Obj-C and Microsoft C++. However, the Microsoft version is [only for importing libraries](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8etzzkb6%28VS.71%29.aspx) and would never refer to a file with an `.h` extension. If we see `#import ""foo.h""` or `#import <foo.h>`, we can therefore conclude the file is Obj-C.

I put together a simple gem called [color-proximity](https://github.com/gjtorikian/color-proximity) to determine the closeness of two colors with each other. It uses [a Euclidean distance algorithm](http://www.compuphase.com/cmetric.htm) to determine likeliness.

This PR adds a test to Linguist to ensure that no two colors in the languages list are too alike. The threshold value of 10 was set by trial and error. If the proximity of any color falls below this value, the test will fail.

For an example of what is considered failure for a threshold of even 20, these two existing colors wouldn't pass:

P.S. That new verison of EscapeUtils adds support for a new method `escape_uri_component` that does URL escaping but with space encoded as `%20` instead of `+` (the way `escape_url` does).

There are two major changes here:
- regex that selects the ""mode:"" portion of the per-file variable specification (which is a more accurate description of the line in the file that holds a variable specification for 'mode', rather than ""modeline"" which is a part of the GUI to emacs speakers.)
- added an alias to the Text language for 'fundamental' because that's the emacs major mode name for pure text.

Caveat: the TravisCI tests ""fail"" now because one of the DTrace test files has an emacs mode line in it that says it should be formatted as a C++ file.  What's the right thing to do about that?

In 33ebee0f6a1e097550df0c7a69c5ffe57223f558 we started detecting a few selected `markup` languages as well. We didn't include all `markup` languages because at the time formats like Markdown and AsciiDoc were labeled as `markup` languages, and we thought that including those prose (i.e., non-code) languages in repository statistics on github.com was misleading for repositories that are largely about code but also contain a lot of documentation (e.g., https://github.com/rails/rails).

This hand-picked set of whitelisted `markup` languages can cause strange categorization for some repositories. For example, it includes CSS (and some variants) but not HTML. This results in repositories that contain the source code for a static website being classified as either a JavaScript (`programming`) or CSS (`markup`) repository, with no mention of HTML anywhere.

Fast-forward to today, and prose languages are no longer `markup` languages; they're now `prose` languages. So now we can include all `markup` languages in repository language statistics without worrying about undesirable effects for documentation-heavy repositories.

It actually solves a few incorrect detections and I think it globally makes sense:

IMO `Modeline` should still be before `Shebang` as it's an explicit statement of content by the user. This PR fixes https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/2081 and https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/1991

@pchaigno said in https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/1991:

> It would require a bit of work since currently the first strategy is also generating the list of candidates but it could surely help solve this type of issue.

I don't believe this is an issue as neither the `Modeline` or `Shebang` strategies rely upon 'incoming' languages like the [`Heuristics` does](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/f5bc9735afee25446f537f6c4f895b80438c53cc/lib/linguist/heuristics.rb#L16). As the `Filename` strategy still precedes the `Heuristics` we should be OK.

2070,1,15,0,Externals,R4PaSs,2017-05-15T08:02:06Z,1536,0,12,832,"Hi,

PEP-8 is not only Python's conventions for code formatting, it is also a dead simple toy assembly language, the repo of the language/environment itself is available on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pep8-1/).

There's not a lot of use for it, being a toy language, it is never used in production environments.

However, we do use it for teaching purposes in a course at the university I'm attending, being a simplified assembly-level language, it is easier for students to approach machine-level concerns without getting too overwhelmed by the complexity of real-world assembly languages such as x86 or ARM.

I'm using Github as a platform for [teaching material](https://github.com/R4PaSs/PEP8-examples), since there will be some PEP-8 code hosted here, I figured this would be a good time to try and have the language recognized and highlighted by Github.

Some students also use Github as a mean to versionize their code, I have a few examples of assignments done by students during previous sessions of the course:
- [4-in-a-row](https://github.com/Freddrickk/Puissance4)
- [Brainfuck interpreter](https://github.com/madeinqc/Pep8-assembly---Brainfuck-interpreter)
- [CamelCase to snake_case converter](https://github.com/madeinqc/Pep8-assembly---Snake-case-converter)

There might be other examples of PEP-8 code on Github, but not that I personally know of.

So I think we should have a new Strategy that checks if a file match one of the filenames defined in `languages.yml`. If it does, then it can return directly the language associated. If none is found, the process can continue as usual.

This new strategy would fix many _miss-detections_ currently happening:
- [`CMakeLists.txt` detected as Text instead of CMake](https://github.com/search?l=text&o=desc&q=filename%3ACMakeLists.txt+cmake_minimum_required&ref=searchresults&s=indexed&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
- [`pom.xml` detected as XML instead of Maven POM](https://github.com/search?l=xml&q=filename%3Apom.xml+xml&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93) (all `.xml` filenames have miss-detections)
- Executable files: see [Makefile](https://github.com/search?l=perl&q=filename%3AMakefile+all&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93), [Dockerfile](https://github.com/search?l=bash&o=desc&q=filename%3ADockerfile+env&ref=searchresults&s=indexed&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93) or [Cakefile](https://github.com/search?l=javascript&q=filename%3ACakefile+if&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

The only drawback I see so far is that there might be some cases where developers use filenames defined in `languages.yml` for other language than what there are usually associated to. I think it's an acceptable drawback because the filenames defined in `languages.yml` are sufficiently specific and if it does happen, they can always use the Overrides.

The only major change here is that we can't install `libicu-dev` globally on the test machine. Instead we extract it to `vendor/debs` and point `charlock_holmes` at it.

Note that the build sometimes fails because apparently the `ace_modes.json` file sometimes can't be downloaded. This would normally cause us to skip the test that relies on that file, but `#skip` doesn't exist in the version of `test-unit` being used on Ruby 2.2. #1930 will fix the `#skip` problem.

1762,18,16,6,Internals,gjtorikian,2014-12-04T19:46:58Z,318,9,5,10,"GitHub and Gist use Linguist's `ace_mode` to determine which highlighter Ace should use when editing a file. When `ace_mode` is not provided, the default value is to just use the language's name, in lowercase.

For the most part, most languages have an `ace_mode` defined, and/or the lowercase default is fine. In other cases, however, this is broken. Consider the following gif:

![go](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/64050/5161183/99149846-7356-11e4-8fea-eff3086eb5a8.gif)

Lest you think that's an obscure language, that broken highlighter is for Go. While the language is itself called ""Go,"" the Ace mode is actually called [_golang_](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/a50fe349250dded26ade026fb1874b7fe681e5b9/lib/ace/mode/golang.js). This property in _languages.yml_ did not have `ace_mode` defined, so the default value did not work, hence the lack of highlighting.

This happens for an irritating number of popular languages (""Common Lisp"" should have a highlighter of  ""lisp""; ""Objective-C"" is ""objectivec""). I [scripted something up](https://gist.github.com/gjtorikian/3e6b307243ff9b3a9b34) to dump out a list of languages that should probably have an `ace_mode` defined (as expected by Ace). Then, I manually went through the list and applied the `ace_mode`s.

Verification is pretty simple; in most cases, the `ace_mode` simply matches very closely with the `tm_scope`. Here's an example of what I mean:

``` yaml
 Frege:
   type: programming
   color: ""#00cafe""
   extensions:
   - .fr
   tm_scope: source.haskell
   ace_mode: haskell
```

Although I have no idea what the Frege language is, I feel pretty confident that a `tm_scope` of `source.haskell` means the `ace_mode` should be `haskell`, too. Almost all of the matches are like this. Note that there are still about 40 languages left that have broken syntax highlighting, but the onus here is shifted onto Ace. because highlighters don't exist for them (for example, Cucumber and F# are represented in Linguist and with a `tm_scope`, but Ace has no highlighter for them).

This ""fixes"" it, but exposes a few more issues:
1. We have some samples with undeclared or wrong shebangs (see test failures). Those need fixed before this can be merged.
2. `samples.json` stores extensions/interpreters, but then we have tests that validate that samples don't use extensions (and now interpreters) that are not declared in `languages.yml`. Should we just remove `extensions` and `interpreters` from the cached `samples.json`, update everything to use the language definitions for those, and rely on the tests to validate that samples are using properly declared extensions and interpreters?

My goal here was to remove Pygments from the equation: we should be able to find a Linguist::Language for any fenced code block without consulting Pygments.

The commit messages explain the process in detail, but the basic idea here is to take all the aliases and file extensions that Pygments knows about and put them into Linguist itself.

I've reworked most of the heuristics to return only one language (we may want to adjust this based upon @pchaigno's comment [here](https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/1656#issuecomment-61925408)).

Also, so that we can make use of a heuristic that _does_ return more than one language, we use the heuristics earlier in the detect method so that the Bayesian classifier can make use of this information.

Each step of the detection is extracted to a ""strategy"". A strategy is just an object with a `#call` method that takes `blob` and `languages` (an array of possible languages).  The strategy returns an array of languages (candidates to be used by the next strategy). It continues to try strategies until 1 language is detected, at which point it returns and does not try the remaining strategies. 

If we like this direction, then there's still work to be done, like tests for each strategy.

1. .asc files were getting marked as AGS Script but formatted as AsciiDoc
2. .asc files that were neither format were also getting marked as AsciiDoc.

So, I added a heuristics checker for .asc files. ~~Additionally, because AGS Script is a nameless language  designed specifically for the Adventure Game Studio tool (and mentioned as `'C'-style script` within the AGS source code, but no one calls it that), I renamed the script to Adventure Game Studio to avoid ambiguity (similar to how the ColdFusion's language is called ColdFusion), and brings more clarity to Adventure Game Studio game projects within github~~.

After making these changes, I cloned a selection of the projects that were incorrectly marked as AGS Script and ran a `exec rake linguist <clone_path> --breakdown` on them to ensure that things were working properly.

Overall I'm reasonably happy with this implementation but there are some issues right now I could do with some help on:
1. I'm having to do [something funky](https://github.com/github/linguist/commit/19c46da714de1140d13e8b7e931299782c8c05b4) in `Rakefile` to try and force a reload of Linguist. This doesn't seem to be working properly as if I run `bundle exec rake benchmark:run index` for the respective commits (19c46da7 & 862bc3c33) then there should be fairly major changes due to [this very destructive commit](https://github.com/github/linguist/commit/862bc3c337f1b2b5eb5be7c8a83f95084663a28f).
2. Testing is a pain with all the `git checkout` stuff. It feels like there should be a better way.

Anyway, I'm off on me holidays for a couple of weeks but will pick this up then.

This is because `data` and the newline regular expression are encoded as ASCII-8BIT or UTF-8, even if the encoding is detected as something else. In the case of UTF-16LE, Windows newlines are encoded as `""\r\0\n\0""`. Because of the `\0` separating the `\r` and `\n`, the current regular expression `(\r|\n)` counts two lines even though it should only be interpreted as one single line break.

The symptom is that [UTF-16LE encoded files with Windows line endings](https://github.com/YuriyGuts/winforms-auto-taborder-vsaddin/blob/master/src/Connect.cs) are rendered with whitespace at the bottom that doesn't actually exist because the line count is calculated as twice what it should be.

I think this is because they aren't that different and, on the small files, the Bayesian classifier isn't very helpful. (It's better than before as BitBake files were not detected at all.)
@e8johan Do you have more representative BitBake files? It could help improve the accuracy of the Bayesian classifier.

The existing colors play on the traditional and played out red and blue motifs, whereas the updated colors, purple and yellow, are not only a more 21st century color color tuple choice but also each come from existing globally proven use cases.

`#f7df1e`, the yellow used to represent JavaScript in this pull request, is also known as ""JavaScript yellow"" as it is the **official** yellow used in the JS logo: https://github.com/jsconf/logo.js/blob/master/js.svg#L19

`#563d7c`, aka ""bootstrap purple"", is an obvious choice for a CSS color refresh as this hex code represents the iconic brand of the most popular stylesheet in the universe.

In preparation for this pull request I first analyzed the current color distribution across all languages ([source available here](http://requirebin.com/?gist=9406519)):

It is used in several repositories on GitHub, for example (these are just a few I could find with a quick google search):
- https://github.com/Medo42/Gang-Garrison-2 (from which I got most of my samples)
- https://github.com/TazeTSchnitzel/Faucet-HTTP-Extension
- https://github.com/ouya/ouya-sdk-examples/tree/master/GameMaker
- https://github.com/Zetaphor/gamemaker-games
- https://github.com/Kojir0/Phase1.gmx
- https://github.com/RealFilling/makeitgrow-game.gmx
- https://github.com/tyrovc/SpelunkyCommunityUpdateProject
- https://github.com/oniofchaos/Game-Maker---AverEnum
- https://github.com/RealFilling/makeitgrow-game.gmx
- https://github.com/grixm/vrilda
- https://github.com/messhof/Networking-in-Game-Maker
- https://github.com/xbelanch/LudumDare25

**EDIT:** Ooh! Doing a search with a common GML function name finds thousands of results:
- [draw_set_color](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=draw_set_color&ref=searchresults&type=Code)
- [instance_create(0,0](https://github.com/search?q=instance_create%280%2C0&type=Code&ref=searchresults)
- [event_user(0)](https://github.com/search?q=event_user%280%29&type=Code&ref=searchresults)
- [ds_list_create](https://github.com/search?q=ds_list_create&type=Code&ref=searchresults)

This yields so many examples that I won't bother listing any of them.

(granted, not all of that's GML, but most of it is)

It's worth noting, however, that Game Maker has two output formats:
- .gmk/.gm8/etc files, which contain an entire project in one binary file (Linguist won't be able to recognise this)
- .gmx directories, which contain a project in hierarchical files and directories in a version control-friendly format (Linguist will be able to recognise .gml files in here). This is only supported by Game Maker: Studio.

As well as those, there is also an open-source tool called Gmk-Splitter which produces a similar source control-friendly hierarchy from a .gmk file for older versions of Game Maker. This is used by some older projects such as the aforementioned Gang Garrison 2.

For the .gmx sort and Gmk-Splitter, it's worth noting that this request only covers raw .gml files (which both Studio and Gmk-Splitter produces for scripts), and not .gmx XML files or Gmk-Splitter .xml files describing object events, which can also contain GML code. It could be possible to add these, but I think these might need to be covered as different ""languages"", due to needing to lex C-like source code embedded XML instead of C-like source code. Even though this means that the pull request offers only limited support, it does mean that all the GML code on GitHub will start being recognised as GML and not ""Shell"" ;)

As well as repositories, there are also many gists using GML.

So, please accept this request, if only such that GML respositories are recognised as GML and not ""Shell"" :)

[Frege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frege_%28programming_language%29) is a non-strict, pure functional programming language in the spirit of Haskell for the JVM.
It enjoys a strong static type system with type inference.
Higher rank types are supported, though type annotations are required for that.

Frege programs are compiled to Java and run in a JVM.
Existing Java Classes and Methods can be used seamlessly from Frege.

The Frege programming language is named after and in honor of Gottlob Frege.

A [previous attempt](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/61) failed, I've tried to avoid its mistakes. A few remarks:
- PostScript is a programming language in the sense of being Turing-complete: see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript). But since it's more often used as a page description language, `type: markup` seems to fit better.
- ""Encapsulated PS"" is not a language on its own, there are just semantic differences between PS and EPS. I also left out the very rare extensions `.epsf` and `.epsi`.
- PostScript is often generated (by `dvips`, for example). I hope that the code in `lib/linguist/generated.rb` covers all such cases.

Added the NetLogo programming language, a dialect of Logo—an adaptation of LISP.
# About

From [Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29)

> Logo is a graphic oriented educational programming language, designed in 1967 by Daniel G. Bobrow, Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon. Today the language is remembered mainly for its use of ""turtle graphics"", in which commands for movement and drawing produced line graphics either on screen or with a small robot called a ""turtle"". The language was originally conceived to enable what Papert called ""body-syntonic reasoning"" where students could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle. There are substantial differences between the many dialects of Logo, and the situation is confused by the regular appearance of turtle graphics programs that mistakenly call themselves Logo.

Source code for the language can be found @NetLogo .

Also added were 3 sample files:
- Ants.nlogo - An simple simulation of ants looking for food
- Life.nlogo - An implementation of Conway's game of life using patches
- Star Fractal.nlogo - A fractal design programmed in NetLogo

More models are available at git@github.com:NetLogo/models.git .
# In the Wild

Logo & NetLogo are very commonly used teaching languages—perhaps one of the most widely used. I have seen many teachers and students store their NetLogo data on github to share.

Netlogo is also often used to create models. Check out a bunch of them here: http://modelingcommons.org/account/login

The reason is to track `phpunit.xml.dist` in your repo. And to ignore `phpunit.xml`. By default everyone (including a CI) would use `phpunit.xml.dist` except you add `phpunit.xml` locally.

`phpunit.xml.dist` has the same XML structure as `phpunit.xml`. So it should be detected as XML by linguist.

It also fixes the Objective-C/MUMPS clash by changing MUMPS' primary file extension to .mumps and adding .m as an alternate file extension.

The third commit adds the sed programming languages as the impetus for this change was a sed script misclassified as perl (which is a pretty good guess).

Pygments added support for Rust in 0.6, so assuming that GitHub has deployed 0.6, this should start highlighting Rust code. Unfortunately, Rust has changed a lot since so the results will probably not be great. Pygments was most recently updated for Rust [in January](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main/commits/5127d7fd8d30308b83a8e7481965c1b906a6f157), with a grammar that is much closer to final. I am hopeful that, even without the updated lexer, the results will at least be better than not having highlighting.

This also adds a big Rust sample, taken from the core library, MIT/ASL2 licensed.

synchronous-looking JavaScript/CoffeeScript, and have it compile to Node-style
asynchronous JavasScript/CoffeeScript. (It's amazing and super elegant.)

https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs

From the start, Streamline was designed to be exactly JavaScript/CoffeeScript,
so that it works with existing editors and tools. No new keywords or syntax --
it simply reserves `_` as a function parameter name.

Streamline files have thus kept `.js` and `.coffee` as extensions, so that no
changes need to be made to tools; Streamline has just used the convention of
ending file basenames with `_`, like `foo_.js` or `foo_.coffee`.

Unfortunately, to get the most optimal Node.js integration, with on-the-fly
compilation (like CoffeeScript), files now need to have their own extension.
So Bruno has decided to make `._js` and `._coffee` the extensions of choice.

The good news is that the language is still exactly JavaScript/CoffeeScript;
it's only the extension that's changed. It's simple to add these extensions
into our editors, but I'm wondering if we can add this to GitHub too. =)

This change is super simple and shouldn't affect any other language, so I hope
you guys are open to it. Thanks for your consideration!
