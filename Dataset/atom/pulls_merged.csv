Previously, we would assign dock elements a minimum width/height of 2 pixels so that we could detect when the mouse approached the edge of a hidden dock in order to show the chevron buttons. This, however, was causing confusion for users, who expected that extra space to be clickable in order to scroll editors located in the center dock.

With this pull request we will instead register a global `mousemove` event on the window right when attaching the workspace element to the DOM (the event handler is debounced, so this shouldn't have any performance consequence). Then, when the mouse moves, we will programmatically detect when it approaches to the edge of a dock and show the chevron button accordingly. This allows us to remove the `min-width` property from the dock container element, which eliminates the confusing behavior described above.

### Alternate Designs

None.

### Possible Drawbacks

This pull request registers a global mouse move event handler and it could be problematic if we did a lot of work inside of it. However, this handler is debounced and runs only after 100ms since the mouse has stopped moving.

This change fixes #13829 which reports that the `softWrapped` setting of an untitled TextEditor is lost when the buffer is saved to a file.  This is caused by logic that updates TextEditor settings when the buffer's language mode changes.

The fix is to mark some editor settings as ""preserved"" so that they do not get change when switching between two language modes that do not have a different value for those preserved settings.

### Alternate Designs

@maxbrunsfeld and I looked into this together and tried to make TextBuffer not use `NullLanguageMode` as the default but instead a `text.plain` mode to avoid the apparent language mode change that caused the user's original issue.  It turned out that this solution would affect setting changes when going from an untitled buffer to a saved text buffer, so it wasn't sufficiently general.  This seemingly small change also had a pretty big impact on existing tests so it seemed too risky as a fix for such a narrow use case.

### Benefits

This solution allows us to easily mark a subsection of `TextEditor` settings to be preserved when the buffer's language mode changes.  This will cause less user confusion while still allowing buffers to have other relevant settings to be updated to reflect the new mode.

### Possible Drawbacks

The current algorithm for checking value changes is not as efficient as it could be.  I was about to try to change `TextEditorRegistry.textEditorParamsForScope` to use chained underscore collection methods but I didn't want to disrupt the current design any more before getting some feedback.

16533,9,4,2,Internals,jasonrudolph,2018-01-11T15:40:56Z,9,3,1,0,"### Motivation

We'd like to add support for a ""dev"" release channel (in addition to the beta and stable release channels). The dev channel would represent the latest successful build on the master branch.

The primary goal is to make it easy to run a package's CI suite against the current Atom master branch to detect potential issues early, as opposed to only discovering issues after master branch is promoted to the next beta release. For example, if teletype's CI suite periodically ran teletype's tests against an Atom dev channel, it would have automatically exposed the issue in https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/300, instead of us having to manually discover that issue. üòÖ 

### Making it happen

For macOS on Circle CI, and rpm and debian on Travis CI, we're already producing the necessary build artifacts to support a dev channel.

For Windows on AppVeyor, the installer task produces the build artifacts that we need ([x64 example](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/atom/build/9355/job/g0vwhhtj59nv283q/artifacts), [x86 example](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/atom/build/9355/job/wypnj96kr308iioo/artifacts)). As of https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15208, we only run the installer task on release branches (e.g., `1.23-releases`). We skip the installer task on all other branches, including master. As a result, our builds on the master branch don't provide the necessary artifacts for a dev channel (e.g., [x64 example](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/atom/build/9371/job/egys9532ba9c59x3/artifacts), [x86 example](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/atom/build/9371/job/egys9532ba9c59x3/artifacts)).

In addition to running the installer task on release branches, **this pull request aims to update the AppVeyor build to also run the installer task on the master branch.**

This pull request fixes a race condition in the `attemptRestoreProjectStateForPaths` function that could cause a file to be opened more than once within the same workspace pane.

In particular, when opening some file into an empty window, Atom tries to recover the state for the project containing the file (if there is one). However, we were previously not waiting until the `AtomEnvironment`'s state had been fully deserialized before trying to load the requested file into the workspace. If the same file also existed in the serialized representation of the workspace, it could end up being opened twice.

With this pull request we will now wait until the environment has been fully deserialized before honoring the user's request of loading new files into an empty window.

This PR fixes two performance problems we've observed when [the new `core.useTreeSitterParsers` feature flag](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16299) is enabled.

1. https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16517. For certain types of syntax errors, the parser would accidentally try thousands of different error recoveries due to a gap in Tree-sitter's logic for limiting the effort spent on error recovery. I've addressed that gap in https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/commit/dafa897021b12a23bb55042c6ef3748f5e807b37.

2. When editing large files, the `TreeSitterHighlightIterator.seek` method spent a lot of time iterating through long lists of syntax nodes looking for the node that contains a given character index in the document. In https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/123, I've added a new native API for quickly finding that node: `ASTNode.firstChildForIndex`.

There are still bugs and performance issues when using the new parsing system which I plan to address next month, but these two were particularly egregious.

### Description of the Change

This pull request updates the ""add selection below/above"" command to only create new selections if they will not be contained within an existing selection.

### Benefits

Other than improving the performance of the above commands, this fixes https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14622 by preventing the need to merge redundant intersecting selections, which was causing selections to be reversed when adding selections above.

### Alternate Designs

* Change the behavior of `mergeIntersectingSelections` to be smarter about the directionality of the resulting merged selections. However, those selections never needed to exist in the first place so we decided to ignore this path.
* Change `TextEditor.addSelectionForBufferRange` to re-use selections when the supplied range is contained by an existing selection. We decided to not go with this approach because of the risk of breaking public APIs.

This PR moves the highlights container inside of the lines for compatibility with themes that add padding or margin to the lines container. This was partially dealt with in #15317 by moving the cursors container, but the highlights container needs to move as well.

### Alternate Designs

We could fix all the themes to also style the highlights container, but that's a tall order.

### Benefits

Things should line up correctly.

### Possible Drawbacks

The `--wait` flag allows Atom to block until you are finished editing a file. Unfortunately, the way it is currently implemented, it simply opens a new Atom window and blocks until that entire *window* is closed. This means that opening a file with `atom --wait` is currently much slower than with `atom`, because the latter command can reuse an existing Atom window.

### Solution

This PR changes the behavior of `atom --wait` so that it doesn't necessarily open a new window. It now uses the same criteria for selecting a window that the `atom` command normally uses, and can be freely combined with any other flag. Examples:

* `--wait --new-window` - reproduce the *old* behavior of `--wait`
* `--wait file1 file2` add multiple files to the current window and block until they are all closed
* `--wait --add some-folder` - add a project folder to the current window and block until this project folder is removed
* `--wait some-file some-folder`

No matter how it is combined with other flags and arguments, `atom --wait` will block until all of the specified paths have been closed.

### Result

Once this change ships, you might consider putting this line to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```sh
export GIT_EDITOR='atom --wait'

**As a contributor**, I often find it useful to explain the steps that I've taken to attempt to verify the results of my changes. For example, see the ""Test Plan"" section in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15183 and https://github.com/atom/teletype-server/pull/36#issuecomment-345392976. This serves two purposes:

1. It forces me to consider the scenarios that deserve to be tested. In writing out a test plan, I often think of things that I hadn't previously considered, and this sometimes reveals other cases to address before shipping.
2. It gives maintainers an opportunity to spot additional manual verification that is warranted. (As a contributor, my test plan is often a way of asking, ""What else should I be testing that I don't know about? Please tell me. :pray:"")

**As a maintainer**, I often want to know what steps a contributor has taken to manually verify the results of their changes.

Initialize `ProtocolHandlerInstaller` after initializing Config. Config is initialized synchronously, so it should be OK to simply reorder them. Without this `ProtocolHandlerInstaller` fails to read the config value on `initialize` which causes the notification to be shown each time on Atom startup even if you select 'never'.

### Description of the Change

My previous attempt to prevent specs from modifying the recent project history (#16255) worked for the most part but had some edge cases that I'm attempting to fix in this PR.  Specifically, #16255 only spied on `atom.history.saveState`.  If a different HistoryManager was instantiated, it would be able to save history state and globally modify the recent project history.  I found this to occur in at least two specs: a Workspace spec that was creating a new AtomEnvironment (and hence associated HistoryManager) and HistoryManager specs that used its own HistoryManager instance.  To prevent _any_ HistoryManagers from modifying project history, spec-helper now spies on the HistoryManager _prototype_ rather than a specific instance.  That means all instances of HistoryManager will now have saveState spied on.  However, since some HistoryManager specs explicitly test saveState, for those tests I temporarily unspy saveState and instead spy on the underlying state store.  My previous ""fix"" for HistoryManager was to spy on `atom.applicationDelegate.didChangeHistoryManager`, which is responsible for broadcasting project history changes to other Atom windows.  This was a faulty implementation because while the project history would appear to be conserved, the state store would still be updated with the incorrect project history data.  Therefore as soon as you opened another window the recent projects menu would again be incorrect.

### Test Plan
* Run some specs in the dedicated spec window and then close it.  Ensure that other non-spec windows have their project history maintained, even after opening a new window.
* Run all Workspace specs.  Ensure that other non-spec windows have their project history maintained, even after opening a new window.
* Run all HistoryManager specs.  Ensure that other non-spec windows have their project history maintained, even after opening a new window.

### Alternate Designs

None.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

The legacy spec helper is in core.

### Benefits

No specs should be able to modify project history unless you explicitly unspy `saveState`.

### Possible Drawbacks

None.

16299,51,13,2,Internals,maxbrunsfeld,2018-01-08T01:24:32Z,1837,80,21,39,"### Overview

This pull request adds a new config setting to Atom: `core.useTreeSitterParsers`, which defaults to `false`. If you set that setting to `true`, when editing files written in certain languages, Atom will use a new parsing system called [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to provide improved syntax highlighting and code folding.

### Syntax Highlighting Improvements

Using the syntax trees provided by Tree-sitter, we can produce syntax highlighting that is more consistent and specific than before. Different kinds of *names* in your code like types, functions, properties/fields,  and local variables should be grouped by color in a more consistent way.

The new syntax highlighting uses the same CSS classes as the old system, so you should be able to continue using your current themes without disruption.

### Code Folding Improvements

Currently, Atom's code folding is based on indentation: in a fold, lines with greater indentation are hidden. This usually gives good results, but it is unintuitive in some cases. Now, by basing the code folding on the *syntax tree* provided by Tree-sitter, we can fold code in an intuitive way regardless of its indentation.

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

Code like this:

```c
int add(int left,
        int right) {
  return left + right;
}
``` 

would previously fold like this:

```c
int add(int a‚Ä¶
```

Now, we are able to fold it like this:

```c
int add(int left,
        int right) {‚Ä¶}
```

or, if you choose to fold the first *two* lines:

```c
int add(‚Ä¶) {‚Ä¶}
```

### New Editing Commands

This PR adds two new text editing commands: `editor:select-larger-syntax-node` and `editor:select-smaller-syntax-node`. These commands can be used to quickly select syntactically meaningful units of code:

* [x] Bash (https://github.com/atom/language-shellscript/pull/93)

### Next Steps

The new parsing system is disabled by default because there are some known bugs and it needs more testing before we roll it out to all Atom users.

### The Issue
Atom window state is not being saved. This means that after closing and reopening Atom, the window size is not the same it was before closing. However, blurring the window saves its dimensions.

### Requirements
![](https://i.imgur.com/dBA4iWH.png)

### Source code files
The window dimensions are being saved (_.atomEnvironment.storeWindowDimensions()_) on _handleWindowBlur()_ and _handleWindowBeforeunload()_ functions in [atom/src/window-event-handler.js](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/window-event-handler.js). However, there should be an event handler function responsible for handling window resizing. If that event handler existed, then it would save the window dimensions every time they were modified.

### Design of the fix
<img align=""right"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/K3Q7fhz.png"">
AtomEnvironment is a class used to deal with packages, themes, menus and the window. This class contains the functions to save and get the current window dimensions.
 
WindowEventHandler is the class containing all the handlers for the window. The handlers worth checking for this issue are _handleWindowBlur()_ and _handleWindowBeforeUnload()_. These are the handlers where the window dimensions are saved. 

In the diagram above we colored the function that we added in green. This function is a handler that activates whenever the user changes the window dimensions. 

### Fix source code
We first created the new event handler by adding this line of code:
```
this.addEventListener(this.window, 'resize', this.handleWindowResize)
```

Then, we had to bind the handler:
```
this.handleWindowResize = this.handleWindowResize.bind(this)
```

Finally inside the handler, we placed the function that saves the window dimensions, like this:
```
handleWindowResize () {
    this.atomEnvironment.storeWindowDimensions()
  }
```

With this fix, we make sure that the window dimensions are always saved whenever the window is resized.

## Alternate Designs

We considered using setInterval to routinely call the function that stores the window dimensions but this method was discarded as it wasn't event driven and slightly lowered atom's performance.

<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->

## Why Should This Be In Core?

People expect atom to save the window size everytime they resize it so that when they open atom the previously saved size is restored.

## Benefits

Explained above.

## Possible Drawbacks

No relevant drawbacks.

### Description of the Change

Previously, whenever running specs your recent project history would get :fire:d and completely replaced with whatever paths the tests you're running decided to open.

### Description of the Change

This change is a bit more involved than making ContextMenu async.  `dialog.showMessageBox` accepts an optional callback as a third argument that, when supplied, makes the resulting message box non-blocking.  Instead of giving the result as a return value, the response is passed to the callback.  As such, always passing the callback (even when it didn't exist) would have been a backwards-compatible change.  To make Atom support both sync and async versions, I have updated `atom.confirm` to also accept an optional callback that determines whether or not to use the async version.  I also noticed while doing this that Atom's implementation was not fully in line with Electron's implementation and was limited in its functionality, and so the async version corrects this by passing all options directly to Electron.  Hopefully in Atom 2.0 we can make async the only supported version.  In the meantime, I've updated all of atom/atom's uses of `atom.confirm` to use the async API and updated the documentation to prefer the async version.

### Alternate Designs

The callbackiness is quite messy, especially when we used to return something based on the response value.  Anywhere where that occurred I had to pseudo-promisify the dialog and then await the resulting promise.  Would it therefore make more sense to directly promisify the async version of `dialog.showMessageBox`?

### Why Should This Be In Core?

`atom.applicationDelegate.confirm` is implemented in core.

### Benefits

Improved UX when a message box appears.  See, for example, snow continuing to fall even when a message box appears:
![async-message-box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2766036/32996023-80f9cd06-cd7d-11e7-9eae-9035e80a8ad6.gif)

### Possible Drawbacks

Unlike making the context menu async, this is an opt-in change.  Package authors will have to update their code to support the async message dialog.  As such, there is a possibility that people will create issues on atom/atom asking why certain message boxes are async while others aren't.  Furthermore, as discussed above, using the callback is much less clean than simply blocking and waiting for a return value.

In #15972, I converted the `TooltipManager` class from CoffeeScript to JavaScript using [`decaffeinate`](https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate):

As part of that conversion (7b76ee3f2593e48ab86fca7e1c602332b4bc8cf7), this line of CoffeeScript:

https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/db960763cfceaaac6a17aaa100a7ea849faabeb6/src/tooltip-manager.coffee#L111

Became this line of JavaScript:

https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/7b76ee3f2593e48ab86fca7e1c602332b4bc8cf7/src/tooltip-manager.js#L127

That change led to the regression described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16135.

A [`for...of` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) requires that the given object implement the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol). As @UziTech points out in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16135#issuecomment-342928215, jQuery objects gained support for the iterable protocol in jQuery 2.2.0, but earlier versions didn't support it. Since many Atom packages use space-pen for their views, and since [space-pen uses jQuery 2.1.4](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16135#issuecomment-342928215), the change in #15972 introduced a regression impacting those packages.

### Proposed solution

To address the regression, this PR does two things:

1. fb74992454f9cfa1027523a3448036e07fc67f20 enhances the existing test that exercises the handling of jQuery objects in `TooltipManager.add`. By using a fake jQuery object that [more closely matches a real jQuery object](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16135#issuecomment-342923149), the test fails with the same error seen in #16135: https://circleci.com/gh/atom/atom/6007
2. 0e82b8bb42ed9ca4a6a12497ffd0622fff0d45e8 replaces the `for...of` loop with a traditional `for` loop, and that fixes the test failure and resolves the bug.

### Proposed test plan

In addition to ensuring that the test suite is passing, I used the following steps to manually verify that this change fixes the bug:

- [x] Install the platform-ide-terminal package and verify that I can reproduce the bug in Atom beta 1.23 (https://github.com/platformio/platformio-atom-ide-terminal/issues/403)
- [x] With this branch checked out locally, open Atom in dev mode and verify that:
    - [x] I don't get the error seen in https://github.com/platformio/platformio-atom-ide-terminal/issues/403
    - [x] I can see the tooltips for the icons that platform-ide-terminal adds to the status bar

If there's any additional verification that would be helpful here, please let me know.

This is a continuation of work started in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15713, with the overall goal of allowing Atom to use parsing systems other than TextMate grammars.

### One Language Per Buffer

The main user-facing change introduced in this PR is that language modes (previously called `TokenizedBuffers`) now belong to a `TextBuffer`, not an individual `TextEditor`. This means that if have you have a file open in 3 different tabs, the file will only be parsed once instead of 3 times for the purpose of syntax highlighting. It also means that when you select a language for the file using the [grammar selector](https://github.com/atom/grammar-selector), your choice will apply in *all* 3 places.

### TextEditor API Changes

Previously, the way to configure an editor's language was to assign to the editor a TextMate `Grammar`, and the editor would internally construct a `TokenizedBuffer` which would use the `first-mate` APIs to parse the buffer.

Now, the `TextEditor` class is no longer responsible for constructing its parser directly; it relies on the buffer having a *language mode* which provides information about syntax highlighting, folding, commenting, and suggested indentation.

This means that the `.getGrammar` and `.setGrammar` methods don't really make sense any more, and neither does the `grammar` parameter to the `TextEditor` constructor. These APIs will continue to work for backwards-compatibility, but will be deprecated at some point.

### Other API Changes

Other language-related APIs like `TextEditorRegistry.setGrammarOverride` were designed around the TextMate concept of *scope names* - strings like `source.js` that are intended to fit into TextMate's scope selector system. Though scope selectors will continue to be a concept in Atom, we will no longer assume that these selectors use the TextMate-style naming conventions. Where possible, I'd like to start referring to these strings as *language ids*, not scope names.

Since TextEditors no longer construct their own language modes, I've moved this functionality into the existing `GrammarRegistry` object exposed as `atom.grammars`. It is implemented in the following methods:

* `atom.grammars.assignLanguageMode(buffer, languageId)` - Assign the buffer a language mode that uses the language with the given id. For textmate grammars, we use the `scopeName` (e.g. `source.js`) as an ID. Tree-sitter grammars will have different looking ids (probably just `javascript`, `go`, etc).

* `atom.grammars.autoAssignLanguageMode(buffer)` - Assign the buffer a language mode that uses the most appropriate language, based on the buffer's file extension and content.

* `atom.grammars.maintainLanguageMode(buffer)` - Assign the buffer a language mode and continue to *update* the language mode as additional language packages are loaded, or the buffer's file path changes.

The `TextEditorRegistry` is no longer responsible for anything to do with grammars. The grammar-related methods will continue to work but they will be deprecated sometime soon.

### Remaining Tasks

* [x] Rename `TokenizedBuffer` to `TextMateLanguageMode` (I'm going to do this in a separate PR to keep this PR's diff more readable).
* [x] Track visibility correctly when a language mode is used by multiple editors

### Next Steps

It should now be possible to integrate [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) parsers into Atom just by changing the `GrammarRegistry` and the `PackageManager`. The core editor no longer assumes anything about how its parser works. Once this is merged, I will begin doing this.",3694,True,en,1

In the `OverlayComponent` resize observer, we're judging whether the element resized by comparing the `contentRect` with the result of a call to `getBoundingClientRect()` [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/text-editor-component.js#L4235). The dimensions reported by these two methods aren't always the same[[1]](https://wicg.github.io/ResizeObserver/)[[2]](https://medium.com/dev-channel/after-mutationobserver-performanceobserver-and-intersectionobserver-we-have-another-observer-for-2c541bcb531b). This results in a resize observer loop while the overlay decorations are present:

In this fix, we store the previous `contentRect` as reported in the `ResizeObserver` callback as state on the `OverlayComponent`. That way in subsequent calls of the `ResizeObserver` callback, we're comparing `contentRect`'s to `contentRect`'s.

16080,1,0,0,Externals,hansonw,2017-11-03T01:31:00Z,38,2,2,0,"### Description of the Change

Atom has supported custom directory providers for quite a long time - the main use case being remote directories, e.g. in Nuclide (https://github.com/facebook/nuclide). The recent addition of file watchers causes several uncaught rejections when a remote directory is added, as it attempts to resolve remote URIs to create a file watcher.

To piggyback on the existing custom directory provider setup, we'll additionally allow custom directories to provide a `onDidChangeFiles` listener (with the same signature as `Project::onDidChangeFiles`) to override the default file watcher.

### Alternate Designs

Another possibility is to suppress file watching for non-local URIs, but this approach allows for greater extensibility as well as real remote file watching if we wanted it. This also opens the interesting option of having the default `Directory` class in `pathwatcher` implement `onDidChangeFiles`, allowing the file watching code to move out of this repo.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

There's no other way for a user-land package to override the file watching APIs.

### Benefits

Improved compatibility with custom directory providers (in particular remote directories).

### Possible Drawbacks

It's unclear how to better document this functionality. It seems that custom directory providers are generally underdocumented though?

### Alternate Designs

I'm unsure whether to use `pre-wrap` or `pre`.  Since `pre-wrap` appears to be the more conservative option, I'm going to stick with that until there's a spec that is easier to read with `pre`.

When the user is typing in the editor, we prevent the insertion of all characters into the hidden input except spaces. If we prevent the default action of space insertion, then the spacebar is interpreted by the browser as a request by the user to page down, so we have to insert it. Unfortunately, if the input is off screen, inserting a space causes the browser to attempt to scroll it into view. Since we implement our own scrolling, this causes content to become hidden.

In this PR, we take the approach of only updating the dimensions of the overlay element and invoking a render on just the overlay component when a resize occurs. The amount of time spent in the overlay observer callback is greatly reduced which means less time spent scripting on keystrokes. This is important because any scripting that occurs as a result of a new keystroke needs to finish well ahead of the next keystroke to avoid holding up its handling.

### Description of the Change

There's a couple of common packages that need to be excluded from the snapshot.  Rather than listing each instance (since they may or may not be deduped), match using `endsWith`.

### Alternate Designs

None.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

Already is.

### Benefits

Less code maintenance if a package is un-deduped or a new dependency of that package is added in a different module.  Also fixes an intermittent build issue for me where an additional fs-extra shows up in github/node_modules/nsfw/node_modules/fs-extra.

### Possible Drawbacks

None.

Previously, we prevented users from dragging the selection further when the buffer was about to change. This was problematic because any change in the buffer, even one that was performed ""automatically"" by a package, would cancel the dragging action and result in a confusing experience for the user. On the other hand, we want to prevent users from accidentally selecting text when they perform an edit (see #15217, #15405).

This pull-request addresses both concerns by canceling the dragging as soon as the user interacts with the keyboard, instead of canceling the dragging when the buffer is about to change. One downside of this approach is that it changes the behavior of pressing a key that does not result in a buffer change, e.g. <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Right-Arrow</kbd>, etc. In fact, pressing one of those keys will now prevent users from dragging the selection further. This seems like an acceptable tradeoff, but we are open to revisiting it in case it introduces pain in some other area of the system.

Previously, when markers were destroyed inside of a `marker.onDidChange` handler that was registered *before* decorating the marker, we would attempt to remove block decorations from the `LineTopIndex` twice: once when destroying the marker, and once when receiving the marker change event.

This was a little counterintuitive at first, because we were already disposing the change event handler associated with the marker upon its destruction. However, we would still receive a marker change event because the marker was getting destroyed *while* notifying its change event subscribers.

With this pull-request we will gracefully handle that situation by remembering that the marker became invalid during its destruction, so that when the change event is finally triggered, it will simply be ignored because the marker validity will not change.

  1. Comment that the issue is still reproducible and include:

It is possible for the approximate screen line count to exceed the actual number of lines. This may happen if there are many soft-wraps and the display layer hasn't indexed the entire contents of the buffer. 

In that circumstance, if a user attempts to scroll to a position that does not exist, we are unable to clip it correctly in `setScrollTop` because the line count approximation is also wrong. Therefore, after populating the spatial index in `updateSyncBeforeMeasuringContent`, we will make sure that the approximate screen line count did not change. If it did, we need to clear the derived dimensions cache (which contains, for example, the rendered row range) because it could contain incorrect values.

Closes #15549
Refs #15263

Due to the fact that the soft-wrapping boundary can change due to a variety of different factors (scrollbars appearing or disappearing, font size changes, editor dimensions changing, etc), we decided to detect changes in the soft-wrap boundary at the start of every frame before proceeding with any other rendering.

This works fine in principle, but prior to this PR it was causing us to write inconsistent values for the `firstRenderedScreenRow` to the per-frame derived dimensions cache in certain edge cases, causing rendering bugs downstream. This could occur when folding caused a document that was scrolled down partially to no longer be tall enough to scroll. This would cause the following unfortunate series of events:

* We would detect the scrollbar becoming invisible due to the shrinking of the content height below the editor height and update the soft-wrap width in [`updateModelSoftWrapColumn`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/3a3c58e04e37f3fe653d742134a0067bc8adb8dc/src/text-editor-component.js#L2099).
* Updating the soft wrap boundary would [*reset* the display layer](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/3a3c58e04e37f3fe653d742134a0067bc8adb8dc/src/text-editor-component.js#L2104), causing it to recompute itself in the background.
* We would then then immediately compute the soft wrap boundary [a second time](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/3a3c58e04e37f3fe653d742134a0067bc8adb8dc/src/text-editor-component.js#L2106). We always compute the soft wrap boundary twice because the initial change in the soft wrap boundary could change scroll bar visibility, which causes the soft wrap boundary to change again. Unfortunately, we were computing the soft wrap boundary *without* forcing a synchronous update for the visible row range of the display layer, and thus not accounting for the presence of the fold and assuming the scrollbar was visible again.
* In the process of computing the soft wrap boundary a second time, we were caching the incorrect values for the first rendered row in `derivedDimensionsCache`.
* Immediately following the update of the soft wrap boundary, we would [populate the display layer for visible row range](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/3a3c58e04e37f3fe653d742134a0067bc8adb8dc/src/text-editor-component.js#L365), causing all future derived dimensions to be based on a correctly populated display layer. This would cause a mix of derived values cached against two different versions of the display layer, leading to inconsistent rendering state.

The solution in this PR is to

* Compute the first rendered row prior to resetting the display layer.
* After resetting the display layer, immediately force it to synchronously populate itself for the visible row range before making any additional computations.

These two steps ensure that the `derivedDimensionsCache` is never populated with inconsistent values. I'm hopeful that this issue was also the source of measurement exceptions in #15263, though we'll have to wait to be sure since we never have reproduced them.

Huge props to @ben3eee and @ungb for their help tracking down this edge case. Thanks so much.

This is the first in a series of PRs to make Atom's syntax related features more flexible.

Currently, code related to auto-indentation and code folding is mostly implemented in a private class called `LanguageMode`, which is constructed with a `TextEditor` instance, and implements most of its functionality by directly manipulating the editor.

This PR removes the `LanguageMode` class and reimplements its functionality in the existing `TokenizedBuffer` class, in a way that does *not* need to manipulate the editor directly. For example, instead of performing folds directly, the `TokenizedBuffer` exposes several pure methods for determining which buffer ranges should be folded.

I converted the `TokenizedBuffer` and its test to JS. For the tests that were previously in `language-mode-spec.coffee`, I have either moved them into `tokenized-buffer-spec.js` or moved them into a new test file - `text-editor-test.js`. I created that new file because I had already converted these tests to JS before realizing that some of them were really about `TextEditor` and not `TokenizedBuffer`, and I didn't want to convert the entirety of `text-editor.coffee` to JS yet. Since the file is so large, we may want to do the conversion gradually.

With this pull-request we will rely on the local `wasValid` variable instead. If its value is `true`, it means that the block decoration has been accounted for in the `lineTopIndex` and must, as a result, be cleaned up in case the marker or the decoration gets destroyed.

Previously, when trying to use block decorations on non-empty markers, Atom could sometimes throw an error if such markers ended or started at a position that was not currently rendered.

In fact, even if we already restricted the decoration query to markers that intersected the visible row range, markers that were only partially visible would still be considered for rendering. If, depending on the `reversed` property, we decided to render the tail or head of the marker in question and this was outside the viewport, Atom would throw the aforementioned exception.

Previously, we were hiding scrollbars when their height/width was 0. On macOS, however, users can decide to only show scrollbars while scrolling, which causes Atom to detect scrollbars as being invisible during measurements. As a result, we were mistakenly setting the visibility property to `hidden` when this setting was on, thus preventing users from seeing the scrollbar on scroll.

With this pull-request we are:

* Changing the dummy scrollbar components to only become invisible when the content is not scrollable rather than when the scrollbars have zero width or height.
* Moving `DummyScrollbarComponent` back into its own GPU layer. This was a workaround that got added back in bac9922 and it's needed in order for scrollbars to be shown properly when the ""Show scrollbars only when scrolling"" setting is on.
* Renaming the `is{Horizontal,Vertical}ScrollbarVisible` functions to `canScroll{Horizontally,Vertically}`, to better express their intent. In fact, if the content is scrollable it doesn't necessarily mean that the scrollbar is also visible.

Previously, when a marker became invalid we would delete the corresponding block decoration from the DOM, without however removing it from the `lineTopIndex`. Also, we had a similar issue when decorating a marker that was already invalid: we would account for it in the index without adding it to the DOM.

This pull-request addresses the above problems by ensuring that block decorations are never added for invalid markers. At the same time, the editor component will still keep track of changes on the marker that was decorated, so that it can detect when its validity changes and render it appropriately.

* Some refactoring on the install script (mainly on the linux part) (1.-3. commit).
* Change the install script to create a separate installation for the dev channel (`atom-dev`) like it is already done for the beta channel (`atom-beta`) (4. commit).
* Change the way icons are handled in the xdg desktop file. This replaces the absolute path used previously with a icon name. The name will then be interpreted by the desktop environment, which in turn selects the icon from a icon theme. This is also how the desktop files in the dep and rpm packages already work. (5. commit).
* Change the install script to copy the application icons (in all resolutions) to the default icon theme. This is required to make to point above work when no alternative icon theme is used or the alternative icon theme does not provide an icon. (5. commit).

### Alternate Designs

None

### Why Should This Be In Core?

* Refactors core code.
* The beta channel is already installed in parallel so the dev channel should be too.
* The new way desktop files are handled is more ""linuxy"" and preferable as default.

### Benefits

* Cleaner code
* Allows all channels to be installed in parallel.
* Users are able to use alternative icon themes with atom; makes atom more hackable.
* The desktop environment gets to choose between different resolutions.
* Aligns the way the manually installed version behaves with the what is installed from a package.

### Possible Drawbacks

None known

This PR addresses three issues related to config settings data loss.

### Issue 1
_config file stops being watched_

Repro steps (on MacOS):
1. `mv config.cson config.cson-bak`
2. open Atom and open `config.cson`. Note that it's empty except for some settings set by packages. Add `editor.fontSize` and set it to something unusual. Note that the font updates immediately after setting it.
3. `mv config.cson-bak config.cson`
4. note that the `config.cson` file updates, but settings are not loaded. That is, if you changed the `editor.fontSize` normally you observe it updating on the spot, but making changes to the file after moving it will do nothing
5. reload the editor and note that `config.cson` has reverted back to its bare state 

Turns out that after step 3 we stop watching the `config.cson` file. Pathwatcher gives us a `delete`, and subsequent file changes do not result in more `change` events so we don't reload the user's config and update the in-memory settings. Reloading Atom flushes the stale settings to disk and overwrites the changes that were made resulting in lost settings. 

The fix implemented in this PR involves using @smashwilson's new bundled file watching service. We reload the user's config on `created`, `modified`, and `renamed` events. 

The bug outlined above resulted in the config file reverting to a previous version of the file prior to being overwritten. It seems that most of the reports in #14909 indicate that the config file was reset completely, which points to a root cause other than what was outlined above. 

The rest of this PR aims to make the code around writing to the config file more airtight. There are only two places where we make calls to `writeFileSync`: 

### Issue 2
_race condition in `loadUserConfig` when a config file does not yet exist_

Previously, there was room for a race condition. An external process could have created a config file after we checked for its existence and before we wrote to the file, potentially resulting in overwriting the changes made by an external process. 
```
      unless fs.existsSync(@configFilePath)
        CSON.writeFileSync(@configFilePath, {})
``` 
Solution: Don't write file if it already exists (depends on https://github.com/atom/season/pull/22)
```
      CSON.writeFileSync(@configFilePath, {flag: 'x'}, {}) # fails if file exists
```

### Issue 3

_race condition in `save()` we write the blank in-memory settings to disk before the first `loadUserSettings()` call_

Previously, there was the possibility that this happened before the in-memory settings were updated to reflect the user's config on disk (`@settings` is initialized to `{}` and updated only after `loadUserConfig` is called). In this case, writing to the file would clobber all the user's settings. This is the most likely cause of the issues reported in #14909. 

Solution: Store of `set` and `unset` operations run prior to loading the user's config and run them once the in-memory settings are updated.

- [x] update `season` to take options

Before this PR running `pane:split-[direction]-and-move-active-item` on an empty pane creates a new empty pane and throws an exception because `undefined` can not be moved. This PR adds a condition to not try and move if `@activeItem` is `undefined`.

With this change the behavior is the same in that we create an empty pane in the direction when doing this but without throwing an exception.

I also added a test for copying empty panes. `pane:split-[direction]-and-copy-active-item` already worked on empty panes before this PR.

### Alternate Designs

We could do nothing if `@activeItem` is `undefined`. But I did not go with this because it changes the behavior and the split functions should return the created pane.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

The code is already in core.

This adds support for listener objects which, in addition to the existing callback listeners, can optionally provide a `displayName` ahead of time to avoid a potentially awkward humanized displayName.

Every object-based listener must implement `handleEvent()`, which plays the role of the callback fired when the command is dispatched.

We can support other first-class metadata, for example I'm preparing a pull request to the command palette to support displaying a command's `description` field as a second line below the `displayName` in search results. I even have an example of adding ""tags"" to a command to help capture keywords a user might use when searching for a command, kind of like how macOS shows ""System Preferences"" as a result for settings:

Here's an example of an object command listener:

```js
atom.commands.add('foo:command', document.body, {
  displayName: 'My awesome foo command',
  description: 'Here\'s some detail about my foo command. Try it out!',
  handleEvent() {
    alert('foo!');
  },
```

It should also be technically possible to attach these properties to a function callback. If we'd like to officially support this I'll add some tests to check:

```js
function myListener() {
  alert('foo!');
}

myListener.displayName = 'My Awesome Listener';
myListener.description = 'Does awesome stuff!';
```

I'll cross-link my command palette pull request which demonstrates the use of this API.

In #15314, @as-cii found a workaround to composition events still firing after a default-prevented keydown event.

If the current `scrollTop`/`scrollLeft` value exceeds the `maxScrollTop` / `maxScrollLeft`, we reassign the values to the max on read. This allows us to behave correctly when the editor has changed in dimensions or the content has changed since the scroll position was previously assigned.

Prior to this PR, we were applying `Math.round` to the scroll positions when assigning them but **not** rounding the values when reassigning them to the max.

In situations where the content height contains fractional pixels, this can lead to a fractional-pixel scroll position when scrolled all the way down/right which causes blurry text. This can also cause unexpected firing of `onDidChangeScrollTop` when the value isn't actually changing due to a decision to notify listeners based on a rounded-up value not matching a fractional clipped value, as was the case in #15343.

This is a continuation of #15266. In that pull-request we managed to prevent IME previews from being displayed in the editor when the originating `keydown` event was default-prevented. However, it was still possible for IME input to make it through the previous workarounds, thus triggering the `textInput` event and showing unwanted text.

Pressing another key that would complete the in-progress IME input would, in fact, first replace `this.lastKeydown` and then trigger the `textInput` event. In the handling of that event we would detect `this.lastKeydown` as ""non-default-prevented"" and therefore mistakenly insert the IME text.

With this pull-request we are adopting a different strategy to mitigate the issue. When receiving the wrong `compositionupdate` event we will first disable the hidden input and then re-enable it on the next tick. Disabling the input causes the in-progress IME input to be aborted and the browser to never fire `textInput` nor `compositionupdate` events anymore after that.

The only downside of this approach is that the hidden input also loses focus, but we transfer it back to it as soon as the next tick of the event loop is served and the input has been re-enabled.

When changing the editor styles, we force the component to remeasure character dimensions. If they change, each line's height could change too, causing the current scroll top position to not match the viewport the user was observing. Thus, when detecting a line height change, we try to show users the area of the screen they were looking prior to tweaking the font size.

In trying to maintain the aforementioned logical position, however, we were mistakenly scheduling a new update before actually finishing the current one. This was problematic because if the first update detected that the longest screen line changed and such line was off-screen, it would try to render it. Before having the chance to measure it, though, the new update would kick in and delete the new longest screen line node, because it assumed it had already been measured. Finally, when
`measureContentDuringUpdateSync` fired, it would notice that the longest screen line node did not exist and throw an exception as a result.

This pull-request changes the `updateSync` method to set the `updateScheduled` flag only before returning control to the caller, as opposed to doing so at the beginning. This prevents calls to `scheduleUpdate` made in `updateSync` from scheduling new unwanted updates.

Calling `pixelPositionForScreenPosition` was sometimes throwing an error indicating that the requested position was not rendered and that, as such, could not be measured.

This was caused by trying to measure a line that was visible at the moment of the call while also having a pending autoscroll request that would cause that line to go off-screen. Due to how the code was structured, we would mistakenly detect that line as visible, autoscroll to a different location, re-render a different region of the buffer and then try to measure the now invisible line.

This commit fixes this issue by restructuring and simplifying the logic for rendering invisible lines in order to measure them. Now, every line for which a measurement has been requested is stored in a `linesToMeasure` map. During the first phase of the update process (after honoring autoscroll requests), we detect which of these lines are currently visible and if some of them are not, we store them into the `extraRenderedScreenLines` map, which is then used to render lines that are invisible but need measurement.

It seems like Chrome 56 has a regression that causes `compositionstart` and `compositionupdate` events to still be fired even if `preventDefault` is called on the original `keydown` event. This PR introduces a workaround that suppresses handling of these events if `defaultPrevented` is true on the most recent `keydown` event.

The `compositionupdate` event is associated with a `data` property that is supposed to contain the full in-progress state of the composed string. Due to a [bug in Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=677050) that has been resolved as of Electron 1.7, that field only contains the most recently typed character in Electron 1.6.

This PR attempts to work around this on Chrome 56 by reading the contents of the hidden input field directly rather than relying on the incorrect `data` property. Since `compositionupdate` events seem to be fired prior to the contents of the input field changing, I perform the read on `process.nextTick` after the browser has a chance to update the field.

One extra wrinkle is I now *clear* the input field on `compositionstart` events so that previous input doesn't pollute the previewed composition. The only keystrokes that could potentially pollute the preview are spaces, since we use `preventDefault` in our `textInput` event handler to prevent every other character from actually being inserted. If we `preventDefault` on space however, it causes the browser's default behavior of scrolling on space, so we have to let that one through. It's okay though, because we're clearing it out when the composition starts.

Etch's reconciliation routine causes elements to be sometimes re-ordered. In order to move an element, however, Etch needs to first detach it from the DOM and then re-append it at the right location.

This behavior is unacceptable for highlight decorations because it could re-start CSS animations on a certain highlight decoration when a completely different one is added or removed.

Even though we are still interested in restructuring etch's reconciliation logic to prevent unwanted re-orderings, with this commit we are switching to a custom routine to create/update/remove highlight decorations that prevents unnecessary moves and, as a result, fixes the undesired behavior described above.

### Description of the Change

A very simple one-liner.  The `m` flag wasn't being added when doing a regex replacement on files not opened in Atom.  For those who aren't aware, `m` changes the meaning of `^` and `$` to mean ""begin/end of line"", rather than ""begin/end of string"" (which can be generalized to ""begin/end of file"" in Atom's case).  The behavior that `m` introduces is consistent with what most developers view `^` and `$` as, and is also what find-and-replace visually shows in the results view.  Therefore, this change fixes the discrepancy between the visual, expected result and the actual result when the regex contains a `^` or `$` and the matched string is not the first/last line in the file.

text-buffer already adds the `m` flag when replacing files inside of Atom.
https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/blob/bb9134fc93713273dcccafd9e917e00f1f2f58cc/src/text-buffer.coffee#L1326

### Alternate Designs

None.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

`atom.workspace.replace()` is a public API.

### Benefits

When searching with a regex that contains a `^` or `$`, replacements should now work as expected.

### Possible Drawbacks

There is one drawback: there is no way to return to the non-multiline behavior of `^` and `$` once the flag is set.  JavaScript does not yet support `\A` and `\Z`.

On Linux, when the user performs a middle-button mouse click, Chromium fires both a `mousedown` event *and* a `paste` event. This PR teaches the `TextEditorComponent` to ignore the `paste` event.

When the user performs a middle-mouse click on a tab, we first get the `mousedown` event. In response to that event, we [close the tab and attempt to prevent Chromium's default processing for the event](https://github.com/atom/tabs/blob/ce1d92e0abb669155caa178bb71166b9f16f329a/lib/tab-bar-view.coffee#L416-L418). This prevents Chromium's default processing for the *`mousedown`* event, but then Chromium also fires a *`paste`* event, and that event pastes the clipboard's current content into the newly-focused text editor. ü§¶

#14987 removed some of the middle-button mouse click handling related to pasting on Linux. This PR restores that logic and the related tests. (See `TextEditorComponent::didMouseDownOnContent(event)`.) With that change in place, since Atom already has its own logic for handling pasting, we shouldn't need to handle browser `paste` events. By ignoring the browser `paste` events on Linux, this PR fixes atom/tabs#461.

As shown in #15158, [these assertions in `spec/text-editor-component-spec.js`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/29810c6cd1924e08126bd18d759b80abfd1c199c/spec/text-editor-component-spec.js#L1462-L1463) occasionally fail on AppVeyor:

```

I haven't been able to reproduce the failure locally, but after discussion with @nathansobo, we have a hunch regarding the source of the intermittent failures. It seems that the flash for class 'c' sometimes ends before the flash for class 'd' happens:

```js
// Flash existing highlight
decoration.flash('c', 100)
await component.getNextUpdatePromise()
expect(highlights[0].classList.contains('c')).toBe(true)
expect(highlights[1].classList.contains('c')).toBe(true)

// Add second flash class
decoration.flash('d', 100)
await component.getNextUpdatePromise()
expect(highlights[0].classList.contains('c')).toBe(true) // <== occasionally fails
expect(highlights[1].classList.contains('c')).toBe(true) // <== occasionally fails
expect(highlights[0].classList.contains('d')).toBe(true)
expect(highlights[1].classList.contains('d')).toBe(true)
```


Prior to this PR, we only flashed class 'c' for 100ms, and perhaps that isn't always enough time. In this PR, we increase the flash duration from 100ms to 1000ms, greatly increasing the likelihood that we're allowing enough time for the flash on class 'd' to take place before the flash for class 'c' ends. (Even 1000ms doesn't _guarantee_ that we're allowing enough time, but we don't have a better solution available at the moment.)

This PR also extracts the involved assertions into their own test, so that 1) we can more clearly explain the scenario that these assertions are testing and 2) it will be easier to isolate any future intermittent test failures related to these assertions.

Upon being shown, modals will have their first tabbable element automatically focused, and shifting focus with the tab key (or more correctly the core:focus-next command) will be limited to the contents of the modal. If the modal does not have any tabbable elements, focus() will be sent to the panel's root element (if it implements it).

I'm happy to update this to *always* calls focus on the panel's root element, but then modal implementers would need to handle that and focus things on their own. I'd argue the tabbable element behavior is more accessible though :)

This has the effect of not automatically closing most of Atom's own modals whenever the tab key is pressed, which was an odd nonstandard behavior, IMO.

This also automates returning focus to the element that had focus before the modal was shown, something up until now had to be implemented in every modal in Atom.

This likely breaks a few contracts for existing Atom packages that create modals, but I've found this doesn't conflict behaviorally with well-behaved modals like the command palette which implement their own focus management (which can be removed if this lands).

```

I haven't been able to reproduce the failure locally, but I have a hunch regarding the source of the intermittent failures. I think it might be a case of ""overspecification"" in the test's assertions. The test expects the blinking cursor to *start* in the visible state, and then transition to the invisible state. When we see the failure above, I suspect that the cursor has already transitioned from the visible state to the invisible state by the time the assertions run.

Since the test aims to verify that the cursor blinks [1], it seems like we should focus on the blinking, and not worry about the *initial* state of the cursor. This PR removes the assertions that verify the initial state of the cursor, and instead asserts that the cursor toggles between the visible and the invisible state.

@nathansobo: Given your familiarly with this test, would you mind reviewing this change? I *think* this change has a good chance of resolving the intermittent failures while still maintaining the spirit of the test. What do you think?

Now, however, `console.log` seems to work irrespective of this environment variable. Furthermore setting this environment variable has the unfortunate side effect of causing lots of fairly low level warning messages from within Chromium's internals to spam the console when Atom is run headless. In this PR, I remove the lines from `atom.sh` and `atom.cmd` that set this variable. It's still possible to automatically assign the variable via the `--enable-electron-logging` flag.

```bash
$ ATOM_HOME=A/ atom
$ ATOM_HOME=B/ atom
```
the second one opens up a new Atom window, but uses packages etc. from `A/`, which feels counter-intuitive. Instead I propose that instances would be per `$ATOM_HOME`. On Linux this can be achieved by having sockets be per-`$ATOM_HOME` it seems.

This would be helpful for IDEs (e.g. [Juno](http://junolab.org/)) which load a lot of IDE-specific features and UI components. With this PR you could simply have a `juno` ""executable"" that wraps around an existing Atom installation, but does not interfere with normal Atom usage:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
export ATOM_HOME=$HOME/.juno
exec atom $@
```

**How does it solve it?** This PR puts the socket into `$ATOM_HOME`, instead of `os.tmpdir()`.

I've been running `1.20.0-dev` with this change for a week or so now and it has been working fine so far. But I'm not sure whether this particular PR is the best solution.

Also, it is Linux-specifc (and macOS?). I can't test this on macOS, nor provide a solution for Windows. If someone could provide a more complete solution I'd be happy if this PR would be superseded.

**Drawbacks/alternatives.** I don't see this affecting normal Atom usage in any way.

In case sockets have to be under `os.tmpdir()` (due to potential filesystem permission issues or something like that?), then an alternative would be to have a `abspath(process.env.ATOM_HOME)`-dependent piece in the socket name, where `abspath` would resolve any relative paths etc.",1688,True,en,0

To overcome issues with npm 5.2, https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15004 and https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15014 configured the build process to use npm 5.1. That change resolved the issues we were seeing with the AppVeyor build [A], but it unintentionally introduced a problem for anyone attempting to build Atom with Node 8.

While the [CI builds use Node 6.9.4](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/3d02234cbdf701a851d9b1239d67dcdbc8808146/circle.yml#L19-L20), we aim to support [Node 6 or newer](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/d61967bff479acbdc6216dc9618879ebe8d23910/docs/build-instructions/macOS.md#requirements). However, pinning npm to 5.1 causes problems when trying to build with Node 8 [B].

To resolve the original problems that we were addressing in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15004 and https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15014, _and_ to restore support for building Atom with Node 8, this PR updates the build to use npm 5.3. The CI builds still use Node 6.9.4, but you should be able to build locally with Node 6 or newer once this PR is merged.

Previously, when `setModel` was called, we forgot to update the pointer to the component in the newly supplied editor. This was causing the element to not update in response to model updates but only as a result of focus or visibility changes. We suspect this regressed during the rewrite of the editor rendering layer.

With this pull request we will now correctly swap the element's underlying editor by updating the component pointer on the newly supplied editor. Also, if the element was already attached to another editor, we will null out the component reference on it, because one instance of `TextEditorElement` can only represent one instance of `TextEditor`.

- There would be other ways like `transform: translateZ(0)` or `backface-visibility: hidden`, but `will-change` is more official.
- We could also promote the parent element `.atom-dock-toggle-button`, but since the ""inner"" element is the one that actually gets transformed, it seems more appropriate.

Some packages rely on `data-screen-row` and/or `data-buffer-row` to provide their functionalities. As part of the editor rewrite, we accidentally removed `data-screen-row` from line number nodes, thus causing some packages (e.g. relative-numbers) to stop working.

With this pull-request, we are adding back `data-screen-row` on line numbers, which makes the packages relying on it work correctly again. As part of this bug fix, I noticed that we were not updating `data-buffer-row` and `data-screen-row` after initially constructing the element they referred to, so I have fixed this inconsistency in bcaf655.

adds an `atom.commands.onDidFinish` function that is called after commands actually finish.

This will require commands that are asynchronous to return a promise so onDidFinish can know when a command is still working asynchronously.

### Alternate Designs

This comes from trying to return a commands value in #14720 

I decided to go with a `did-finish` event to keep backwards compatibility and use the event emitter already attached to `atom.commands`

This event is emitted once `Promise.all` on the return values of the command listeners finishes. Therefore it will be emitted when all listeners are resolved or one listener is rejected. And only the dispatched event is provided. A couple things could be changed here:

- We could wait until all listeners are resolved or rejected.
- We could emit a different event if rejected.
- We could include the returned values of the commands.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

It requires changes to the command registry and package creators to return a promise if the command is async.

### Benefits

- Ability to tell when an async command actually finishes.
- Ability to dispatch commands in series.

### Possible Drawbacks

Package creators will need to come on board for this to be very usefull

14853,97,15,5,Internals,smashwilson,2017-08-08T18:04:40Z,1840,27,32,48,"This will add a central filesystem watcher to Atom's core API, so that multiple packages can share the same native filesystem watchers, conserving operation system resources.

There are a _ton_ of Node filesystem watcher packages with varying degrees of cross-platform compatibility, error resilience, and sophistication of configuration. To keep our scope from creeping uncontrollably, the first version we ship will target _only_ the minimum functionality that we need for bundled core packages and @damieng's language server integration.

See the original discussion in #14163.

## API

This will add two public methods to subscribe to filesystem changes, an ""extended"" general-purpose one to recursively watch any directory tree, and a ""public"" specialized one to watch for changes within project roots that are open within `atom.projects`.

The general-purpose one will involve calling `watchPath` instances directly, by means of a function exported from the `atom` require:

```js
const {watchPath} = require('atom')

const watcher = watchPath(rootPath, {}, events => {
  // Accept batch of events
})

const disposable1 = watcher.onDidError(err => {
  // Handle error
})

// After this promise resolves, changes made to files on the filesystem will result in
// the registered callback(s) being invoked
await watcher.getStartPromise()

// After this promise resolves, all OS watcher resources will be disposed
await watcher.dispose()
disposable1.dispose()
```

 * `rootPath` can be a path anywhere on the filesystem.
 * If `rootPath` is a directory, its contents will be watched recursively. If it's an individual file, only that file will be watched.
 * The `PathWatcher` instances returned by `watchPath()` may be backed by an existing native filesystem watcher on the same root path or a parent directory.
 * The native watcher may also be swapped out if a watcher is started on a parent directory, or if its native watcher is assigned to a parent directory but the parent watcher is disposed. All of these changes are transparent to consumers.
 * `getStartPromise()` is useful to have for writing test cases - you want to be sure the watcher is initialized and receiving events before manipulating the filesystem. It will _not_ be necessary to wait for the watcher to start before subscribing to events, though.

```js
const disposable = atom.project.onDidChangeFiles(events => {
  // ..
})
```

 * This API will be implemented with the other. Notably, watchers created here will participate in the deduping process described above.
 * As new roots are added to the project or removed, existing event subscriptions will be adjusted accordingly.

In both cases, the payload delivered to the change callback is an Array with the following structure:

```js
[
  {
    ""action"": """", // one of ""modified"", ""created"", ""deleted"", or ""renamed""
    ""oldPath"": """", // undefined unless type is ""renamed,"" in which case it holds the former name of the entry
    ""path"": """" // absolute path to the changed entry
  }
]
```

üóí  I'm writing this initial cut with [nsfw](https://github.com/Axosoft/nsfw) (which we use in the GitHub package). I'm planning to merge this PR still using nsfw and cutting atom/github over to using it as part of the next release so we're no worse off in stable than we are today.

After :ship:, I'll replace it with a bespoke native watching module. nsfw launches two threads for each watched directory root, which makes me nervous to use it to back a user-facing API.

## Remaining Work

- [x] Create a `NativeWatcherRegistry` to manage the attachment of native watchers to userland watchers.

### Description of the Change

#13947 introduced a regression with `atom --test` where if `core.restorePreviousWindowsOnStart` was set to `always`, `atom --test` would ignore the supplied directory and instead test specs in the first folder you opened.  Had a very fun time trying to figure out why `atom --test spec` was running `language-html` tests instead of `tree-view` ones...

### Alternate Designs

None!

### Why Should This Be In Core?

Because I would like to be able to tell Atom where I want the specs to be run!

### Benefits

Being able to test any directory from the command line regardless of where Atom was started!

### Description of the Change

Fixes some issues with the new Docks documentation.  In particular, the documentation to `get{Left|Right|Bottom}Dock` was pointing to the wrong class and the methods themselves weren't public.

Please note: While adding documentation to the dock methods, I noticed that while `WorkspaceCenter` had docs for its individual methods, it did not have documentation for the class itself and therefore was not showing up as part of the API.  Therefore I've added a short blurb to the class.

The documentation I added was based off my best judgement and the comments for similar classes/methods; please feel free to improve them.

> Note: Only available if `Atom > Settings > Core > Title Bar` is set to `native`.

### Alternate Designs

Was wondering if it should be a config, but I think it's not needed. Because:

1. Electron is smart enough to [only show](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/dfab1043d98067b43b45d8dcbe9d0b84d4820555/atom/browser/native_window_mac.mm#L789-L790) the native tabs if there is also a native title bar. So [issues](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14197) with hidden/custom title bar shouldn't be a problem.
2. You can control if Atom should open as a native tab or new window by going to `macOS > System Preferences > Docks` and change this:

### Why Should This Be In Core?

It's part of the `browserWindow` options.

### Benefits

Makes it possible to tab between multiple Atom windows.

### Possible Drawbacks

People might not like this change if:

1. They prefer opening as tabs for all other apps (like Finder), but not for Atom.
2. They don't want to switch to a custom title bar.

Something else I noticed: If you have the DevTools open (as a separate window) and close the Atom window, the DevTools window moves as a tab to another existing Atom window. Not sure if that's an edge case to be ok with?

Note the number of nodes (in green) has reduced from ~50k to ~5k (10x reduction).

As the first step toward resolving #14648, this pull request implements the proposal outlined in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14648#issuecomment-305017095:

> - Disallow editors in docks. Only allow editors in the workspace center.
> - Change `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` to return the active text editor (if any) in the workspace center. (This is more consistent with the pre 1.17.0 behavior described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14648#issuecomment-304381899.)
> - Introduce `atom.workspace.observeActiveTextEditor()` as a means of observing the active text editor. (Packages like encoding-selector and grammar-selector _want_ to observe the active text editor, but currently have to rely on observing the active pane item, which is problematic for the reasons described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14648#issuecomment-304391943.)

Once this pull request is merged, I'll then be able to update each of the core packages that currently use `atom.workspace.observeActivePaneItem()` to instead use `atom.workspace.observeActiveTextEditor()` to receive notifications each time a different text editor becomes active. Once that's done, we'll be able to close #14648.

### Alternate Designs

- For packages that need to observe the active text editor (e.g., https://github.com/atom/status-bar/issues/194), we could require those packages to observe all pane containers and watch for a text editor to become active in that pane container. Because observing the active text editor is a common need, I'd rather provide a core API for this functionality and not require each package to implement and maintain this logic.
- Instead of disallowing editors in docks, we could teach `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` to first check for an active text editor in the active pane container and return it if it exists, and to otherwise return the active text editor (if any) in the workspace center. `atom.workspace.observeActiveTextEditor()` would need to use similar logic to notify observers each time the value of `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` changes. This approach would likely allow us to resolve https://github.com/atom/status-bar/issues/194, but it feels overly complicated, and it seems like something that is more likely to cause future confusion, surprise, and additional maintenance overhead.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

It's the first step toward resolving #14648.

### Benefits

- Developers will have a core API for getting notified when:
  - A text editor becomes the active text editor
  - There is no longer an active text editor
- The behavior of `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` will [more closely match its pre-1.17.0 behavior](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14648#issuecomment-304381899), which various [packages relied on](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/pull/904).
- We answer the question, ""Does it make sense to have an editor in a dock?"" Answer: No. Atom expects to find editors in the workspace center. Docks are intended to provide supporting tools like a tree view, a debugger, a console. xref: http://blog.atom.io/2017/05/23/docks-deep-dive.html
- It reduces (hopefully ü§û) the overall number of scenarios that need to be considered in Atom core and in packages that interact with editors (e.g., https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues/901#issuecomment-304078622).

### Possible Drawbacks

- By disallowing editors in docks, we reduce Atom's overall flexibility. If someone comes up with a compelling reason for using an editor in a dock, they're out of luck.
- Implementing `getAllowedLocations()` on an item affects where the item opens when using `atom.workspace.open()` and when [dragging an item to a dock in the UI](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/16e1ef917be66637a58bad5e09c7d546782ee6e8/src/dock.js#L228-L229). However, functions like [`Pane::addItem()`](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.17.2/Pane#instance-addItem) currently allow you to add the item to any location, regardless of the locations returned by the item's `getAllowedLocations()` function. In other words, there will continue to be ways to programmatically add a text editor to a dock, even though we're discouraging it and considering it to be unsupported behavior.

In this version, we've elected to handle `showLineNumbers` differently from `lineNumberGutterVisible`. We continue to render the line number gutter (which contains diff decorations, fold indicators, etc), but we just don't render the line numbers in it.

We attach resize listeners to overlays so we can update their position when they change sizes to avoid overflowing the window. However, resize events occur more frequently than we assumed, such as when the element is first attached to the DOM or when the resize listener is detached and reattached to avoid emitting warnings. Handling these extra resize events was heavily impacting performance. To avoid this, we now only process resize events when they report a client rect that differs from our most recent measurements, avoiding redundant updates.

A better approach would be to use SVG for the icons, instead of a font. Then the icons could be multi colored, be animated, easier to position without sub-pixel blurryness and easier to update/maintain.

Downside: You can't just use a class to add an icon. The SVG needs to be added to the DOM. Atom would need some sort of `<atomicon name=""array"" />` to `<svg class=""atomicon atomicon--array""><path d=....</svg>` injector. Like [etch-octicon](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/etch-octicon).

Maybe still worth to try that before making these part of the official style guide. This PR is mostly to add icons to the Outline view package.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

The Octicons are also in core.

### Benefits

More relevant icons.

### Possible Drawbacks

Maintenance cost.

Updated atom.confirm documentation to include what happens if dialog is closed without selecting an option

### Possible Drawbacks

I had to do quite a bit of experimentation on Windows to figure out all the edge cases.

Most of the information I got from the [dialog.showMessageBox](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/dialog.md#dialogshowmessageboxbrowserwindow-options-callback) documentation but there seems to be quite a few differences between Oses

`WorkspaceCenter`'s `observeTextEditors()` method calls `this.onDidAddTextEditor()`, but `WorkspaceCenter` didn't have an `onDidAddTextEditor()` method. This pull request adds a test for `WorkspaceCenter`'s `observeTextEditors()` method, and it adds the missing `onDidAddTextEditor()` method in order to make the new test pass.

None.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

It fixes bugs in existing core methods.

### Benefits

The `observeTextEditor()` method in `WorkspaceCenter` will successfully invoke the given callback for all current and future editors in the workspace center.

#### Functionality Description

Prior to this change, the following commands successfully operated on panes in the workspace center, but they could not focus/move/copy between the the panes in the workspace center and panes in the docks:

- `window:focus-pane-above`
- `window:focus-pane-below`
- `window:focus-pane-on-left`
- `window:focus-pane-on-right`
- `window:move-active-item-to-pane-above`
- `window:move-active-item-to-pane-below`
- `window:move-active-item-to-pane-on-left`
- `window:move-active-item-to-pane-on-right`
- `window:copy-active-item-to-pane-above`
- `window:copy-active-item-to-pane-below`
- `window:copy-active-item-to-pane-on-left`
- `window:copy-active-item-to-pane-on-right`

This pull request updates these commands to work across all visible panes, regardless of whether the pane is in the workspace center or in a dock.

#### Implementation Summary

- Prior to this change, the [directional pane focus/move/copy logic resided in `PaneContainerElement`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/7cfcdadbfbc2169b99893107f43be0fb3c2bbd30/src/pane-container-element.coffee#L27-L94). By hosting the logic in `PaneContainerElement`, we could only focus/move/copy between panes in a specific pane container (e.g., a single pane container in the workspace center). To make it possible to focus/move/copy between _all_ panes in the workspace, relocate the logic to `WorkspaceElement`.
- Add [tests for `nearestVisiblePaneInDirection`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/e3c612b261d658f492d7456dc9c18ccb48f23aa6/spec/workspace-element-spec.js#L37-L232), which provides the core logic for the higher-level functions like `focusPaneViewAbove`, `moveActiveItemToPaneAbove`, `focusPaneViewOnLeft`, etc.
    - Test the generic logic extensively (i.e., the logic that is independent of whether the given pane resides in the workspace center or a dock)
    - *Also* test the navigation between docks and the workspace center
- Since the core directional logic is tested in the new tests above, simplify the [tests for the higher-level functions](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/e3c612b261d658f492d7456dc9c18ccb48f23aa6/spec/workspace-element-spec.js#L234-L483) (e.g., `focusPaneViewAbove`, `moveActiveItemToPaneAbove`, `focusPaneViewOnLeft`) to avoid unnecessary duplication.

### Alternate Designs

- We could perhaps leave the existing functions in `PaneContainerElement` and update them to focus/move/copy across pane containers, but it would seem odd (to me) to have something in `PaneContainerElement` operate on elements that exist in _other_ pane containers.
- We could leave the existing functionality in place and _add_ new commands that provide the ability to focus/move/copy across pane containers.
    - This would result in more code to maintain.
    - It would require us to come up with command names that distinguish the old behavior from the new behavior (e.g. `window:focus-pane-above` and `window:seriously-focus-pane-above` :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
    - I can't think of a compelling reason to the limit pane navigation commands to a single container. If you know of real world value that developers get from only being able to focus/move/copy between panes in a single pane container, please let me know. :pray:

### Why Should This Be In Core?

The existing commands reside in core, and this change updates them to support the docks that were recently added to core.

### Benefits

Developers gain the ability to focus/move/copy across *all* visible panes. Developers are no longer limited to focusing/moving/copying between panes in the workspace center.

### Possible Drawbacks

`PaneContainerElement` is not part of Atom's public API, but it's possible that some packages are relying on functions in `PaneContainerElement`. This pull request removes several functions from `PaneContainerElement`. If any packages are relying on those non-public functions, those packages will encounter errors when attempting to invoke those functions. Hopefully package authors would discover those issues during the next beta release, so that they could adjust their packages accordingly.

### Applicable Issues

https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/1484 introduced the ability to navigate directionally between panes.

This change enables the maximum softWrapColumn in the display layer object to be set using a configuration parameter rather than using the MAX_SCREEN_LINE_LENGTH constant. This value is returned by the getSoftWrapColumn function.

The default and minimum is still set at 500 to satisfy the design decision to address performance issues for those opening minified files, however it can be adjusted upwards for those who require a more flexible option.

### Alternate Designs

As the getSoftWrapColumn function used a constant as the default return value, there are no alternate design options.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

This needs to be in core as it is affecting the editor display layer parameters directly 

### Benefits

Benefits are that the number of people who work with long line files that are not necessarily minified are able to customise their maximum width by the settings editor instead of using the constant value

### Possible Drawbacks

Possible drawbacks are that a user sets the width high enough to cause performance issues with minified files, however this can be mitigated by reverting the setting to defaults in the editor settings

### Description of the Change

Prior to this change, when a dock had focus, triggering `window:focus-next-pane` or `window:focus-previous-pane` would throw an error:

```

[`Workspace.activateNextPane()` calls `this.getActivePaneContainer().activateNextPane()`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ae9f24602d80cb15fe0edc15c1aae37d44ee786c/src/workspace.js#L1361). `this.getActivePaneContainer()` returns either a `WorkspaceCenter` (if the workspace center is the active pane container) or a `Dock` (if a dock is the active pane container). `WorkspaceCenter` has an [`activateNextPane`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/8ed16cea43cfd3f3b04b51ed5851892944ac7f19/src/workspace-center.js#L290-L298) function, but `Dock` does not. Therefore, calling `Workspace.activateNextPane()` results in an error when a `Dock` is the active pane container. (The same goes for `activatePreviousPane`.)

This change resolves this issue by [adding `activateNextPane` and `activatePreviousPane` functions to `Dock`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ae9f24602d80cb15fe0edc15c1aae37d44ee786c/src/dock.js#L629-L637).

With this change in place, triggering `window:focus-next-pane` or `window:focus-previous-pane` in a dock will focus the dock's next or previous pane respectively. If the dock has only one pane, then that pane will remain focused. In other words, these two commands should provide the same behavior regardless of whether they're executed in a dock or in the workspace center.

### Alternate Designs

None.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

It's a fix for an existing bug in atom/atom: #14442

### Benefits

Fixes #14442.

### Possible Drawbacks

From a functionality perspective, I'm not aware of any drawbacks.

From a code perspective:
- It seems like there's an interface that we expect both `Dock` and `WorkspaceCenter` to implement, but I don't see that interface explicitly described or enforced anywhere. I _think_ that lack of explicit interface is a cause of the bug seen in #14442. There may be other bugs that are lurking due to code that implicitly expects a `WorkspaceCenter` and a `Dock` to provide a common interface.
- [`Dock`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/8ed16cea43cfd3f3b04b51ed5851892944ac7f19/src/dock.js) and [`WorkspaceCenter`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/8ed16cea43cfd3f3b04b51ed5851892944ac7f19/src/workspace-center.js) have quite a bit of duplicate code ([side-by-side screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2988/26175132/a7d9c034-3b1f-11e7-9586-f738646b7440.png)), and this PR adds even more. Perhaps a future refactoring could reduce this duplication.

This pull request completely reimplements the `TextBuffer` class - Atom's core data structure representing editable text. The new implementation differs from the old one in several major ways:

* The class is now implemented primarily in C++, as part of our native library [superstring](https://github.com/atom/superstring).
* Instead of storing the text as a mutable array of lines, we store it as flat immutable string representing the file's original content, plus a *Patch* representing the user's unsaved changes. This is somewhat similar to the [piece table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table) data structure used in some other editors.
* At the native level, the buffer supports *snapshots* - read-only views of the buffer that can be processed in background threads with no copying or locking, even while the buffer is being mutated on the main thread.
* File I/O and transcoding is now handled by the native library, entirely on background threads and exposed via promises.

### Motivation

For many purposes, the existing array-of-lines implementation was actually very fast; we've never observed slowness associated with the querying or mutating of the text itself. This is a testament to V8's highly efficient String operations. However, there are many operations in Atom that *use* the `TextBuffer` and would benefit from being dropped to C++ and/or being moved to a background thread.

Here are some examples of this that have already been addressed in this PR:

* Previously, saving and loading a `TextBuffer` required its entire contents to be represented as a single JavaScript String. V8 has a hard limit on string length, so this would cause errors (#7210). Now, saving and loading are done in a background thread in C++, with minimal copying of data.
* When the file associated with an unmodified `TextBuffer` changes on disk, we diff the file's new contents with the buffer's contents in order to update the buffer in a way that preserves marker positions. Previously, this diff computation caused unresponsiveness in large files (atom/text-buffer#153). Now the diff is performed in C++ and on a background thread.
* Whenever the application is idle, we serialize the state of the window and persist it, so that we can restore it even if Atom crashes or power is lost. Previously, persisting a large file's text would cause hangs, so we had to disable this safety feature for large files (#13583). Now, because of our new representation of the buffer, we are able to efficiently serialize *just* the outstanding changes, so we can re-enable the feature for arbitrarily large files.
* The [line-ending-selector](https://github.com/atom/line-ending-selector) needs to detect what type of line endings a `TextBuffer` uses. Because we support files with *mixed* line endings, this entails scanning the entire buffer. Previously, this would take upwards of 50ms for a large file. Now, the search is performed asynchronously so that it causes no noticeable lag.

In addition to these improvements, this PR will make it very easy to optimize other features. Here are some follow-up PRs that I have in mind:
* When changing a large amount of text at once, indexing the new text in the `DisplayLayer` takes a long time. This is one of the main reasons that pasting a huge amount of text is slow. Some of this character-by-character computation could probably be done much faster in C++.
* Currently, using the [find-and-replace](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace) package in a very large file can cause hangs when searches produce more than a hundred thousand results. We will now be able to run searches entirely in a background thread, eliminating any lag.
* Populating the [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus) package's `SymbolStore` can take a very long time for large files, so we had to [disable it](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/pull/782) for large files. Fuzzy matching should be able to be performed in C++ on a background thread, eliminating this restriction.

### Implementation details
<details>
<summary>Our new representation of the buffer:</summary>
<br/>

Suppose I create a `TextBuffer` with some initial text and then make three edits:

```js
const buffer = new TextBuffer('abc\ndefg\nhijkl')
buffer.setTextInRange([[0, 2], [0, 3]], ""C"")
buffer.setTextInRange([[2, 0], [2, 1]], ""H"")
buffer.setTextInRange([[1, 1], [1, 2]], ""E"")
assert.equal(buffer.getText(), 'abC\ndEfg\nHijkl')
```

This buffer is now represented internally like this:

![graph-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326587/26644547/f3bbc95a-45e9-11e7-91a4-ceee77e90ecc.png)

The buffer is composed of two *layers*. The first layer stores the buffer's initial text as a flat, immutable string. This makes freshly-opened files very compact in memory. The second layer stores the unsaved edits in an object that we call a `Patch`. The `Patch` is structured as a [splay tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree) so that mutations and queries are very efficient, especially in areas that have recently been accessed.

Then, suppose I begin some asynchronous operation like saving the buffer to disk, or searching 
the buffer for a regex. Then, *while* that operation is still happening, I make some *additional* edits:

```js
const savePromise = buffer.save()
buffer.setTextInRange([[0, 0], [0, 1]], 'A')
buffer.setTextInRange([[2, 4], [2, 5]], 'L')
assert.equal(buffer.getText(), 'AbC\ndEfg\nHijkL')
```

At that point, the buffer's internal state would look like this:

![graph2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/326587/26644968/63dd6562-45eb-11e7-9d66-9dfe94d243d9.png)

There are now *three* layers. Because the asynchronous `save` is still in progress, further changes that we make to the buffer are saved in a *new* Patch. When the `save` completes, we flatten the text down into one layer again.

</details>

### Effect on packages

I don't believe making `save` async has affected any of our bundled packages' functionality, though it has caused some test failures that I've had to fix:

* [x] https://github.com/atom/whitespace/pull/155

For posterity: In addition to some more exciting changes ‚ú®, this PR makes some changes to the way we run tests. In particular, if a core package has an `atomTestRunner` entry in it's `package.json`, we now perform the following operations:

2. Run `apm install` inside the package folder to install all its devDependencies
3. Run the tests as usual
4. Remove the new `node_modules` folder and rename `node_modules.bak` to `node_modules`

The file `src/win_delay_load_hook.cc` is required for node_gyp to build native dependencies on Windows. This overrides the exclusion of `*.cc` and `*.h` sources from the packaged app for this specific, odd case, allowing native dependency builds to succeed again.

### Alternate Designs

I tried to find a way to modify the existing regexp to prevent `EXCLUDED_PATHS_REGEXP` from matching this file, but unfortunately JavaScript doesn't support negative lookbehind and I was concerned about the risk of an explosion in computational complexity with the workarounds.

I also considered splitting the `*.(cc|h)` exclusion rule into more specific exclusion rules, but there are too many of each that we _do_ want to exclude (all of the others; currently about 375 *.cc and 1000 *.h files). That would also cause a maintenance issue when adding any new dependencies with native components in the future.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

That's where the build scripts are :wink:

### Benefits

Attempting to build native dependencies on Windows machines fails with an error containing the following:

```
c1xx : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: 'C:\Users\foo\AppData\Local\Atom x64\app-dev\resources\app\apm\node_modules\node-gyp\src\win_delay_load_hook.cc': No such file or directory [C:\Users\foo\Documents\GitHub\xyz\node_modules\keytar\build\keytar.vcxproj]

Modify the Travis, Circle CI, and AppVeyor build metadata to only create branch builds for `master` and release branches named `x.y-releases`. This should help our build queue situation somewhat.

Note that _pull request_ builds should still be triggered on all three systems.

### Alternate Designs

We could do this by adding logic to the build scripts themselves to detect when they're being executed on a branch build that will also create a PR build, but there's no reason not to use the built-in solutions for this.

AppVeyor and (I believe) Circle both allow you to configure this setting in their own web UIs. I generally prefer to keep build configuration within the repository as much as possible, though, it's less confusing and we can manage it with pull requests (like this one!).

### Why Should This Be In Core?

The core build metadata files are in core :grin:

### Benefits

This will decrease the extraneous builds that are created when maintainers push branches to the atom/atom fork and create pull requests from them, which is [common in our workflow](https://github.com/atom/atom/branches/all). This results in _two_ builds for each push to a feature branch: one from the push to the feature branch and one from the pull request event:

<img width=""694"" alt=""screen shot 2017-04-18 at 12 54 21 pm"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17565/25142789/2ab061c6-2436-11e7-8ca7-146a88846b10.png"">

Running fewer builds will result in less queue pressure and more rapid feedback on changes.

### Possible Drawbacks

Running the tests less often may cause us to miss flaky failures that happen only occasionally. We will also lose the ability to distinguish failures that are present on the branch itself (from the branch build) from those that are caused by the merge into master (from the pull request build).

### Applicable Issues

We've agreed to hold off on changing the build for a day or so to more easily isolate the cause of any problems from #13646.

finding paths to transpile during compilation

### Description of the Change
Before this PR, building Atom involved transpiling all babel paths, coffeescript files, cson files, etc. by globbing for all paths matching (essentially) `**/*.js`, `**/*.coffee`, etc. Node modules like term.js appear in the directory structure as `node_modules/term.js/<contents>`, which previously caused the folder `node_modules/term.js` to be added to a list of paths to transpile under the assumption that it was a file. This causes an error when [trying to read the folder](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/compile-cache.js#L84)) `node_modules/term.js`. This PR fixes that by enabling the `nodir` option, which filters out any directories from being in the results. While I only specifically witnessed this issue in finding javascript files, the bug also exists in the coffeescript, CSON, PEG.js, and custom transpilers if someone names a directory *.coffee, *.cson, or something else expected to be transpiled.

### Alternate Designs
One could check if the path attempting to be transpiled is actually a directory where the error occurs right before transpiling, but glob already checks if the path is a directory.

### Why Should This Be In Core?
Proposed update to building atom

### Benefits
Can include node_modules named like module.js.

### Possible Drawbacks
In the future, if the [transpiler ](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/compile-cache.js#L83) (or a custom one) may support directories? In this event, a glob pattern that ends with a `/` still grabs directories (even if `nodir` is enabled).

### Description of the Change

This should fix some regression introduced by commit https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51 related to `showSaveDialog` causing things such ""Save As"", ""Save as HTML"" to not work properly (default filename ""Untitled"" and default path missing when it should be autofilled with more ""reasonable"" ones--e.g. original filename and path). 

This commit fixes the erroneous usage in [`src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L268`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51/src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L268) introduced in commit https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51
```coffeescript
dialog.showSaveDialog(this, params)
```

Here, `this` refers to an instance of AtomWindow, when the function `dialog.showSaveDialog` requires the first argument to be a BrowserWindow [`electron/lib/browser/api/dialog.js#L24`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/browser/api/dialog.js#L24). 

So I believe the fix is simply 
```coffeescript
dialog.showSaveDialog(@browserWindow, params)
```

This is consistent with with the function binding usage in [`src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L86@c6cae5b`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/c6cae5b8fdfea982084b068a0b38a7c988c52f51/src/main-process/atom-window.coffee#L86) and with the **old** working function `showSaveDialog` in [`src/application-delegate.coffee#L158`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ae9d949ee4e199d1884bed89083196fa375bbd34/src/application-delegate.coffee#L158)

In addition, this pull request improves the way packages are resolved and, as a result, minimizes the I/O cost associated to it. Previously, in fact, because of the way the code was structured, we would get the list of package directories and constantly issue a `resolvePackagePath` for each of them. This, in turn, would unnecessarily verify again that each path was a directory, thus querying the file system and blocking the main thread. After these changes, we will perform that I/O just once and return a javascript object which contains all the information needed to load the associated package without extra cost.

You can notice how startup got `~ 90ms` faster, and packages loading alone became almost instantaneous. I am expecting this to be even more noticeable on machines that have slow hard drives, where the cost of I/O is much more dramatic.

This marks the end of the first round of performance improvements that can be achieved thanks to snapshots; there are still many things we can improve both in the renderer process and in the browser process, especially related to the scheduling of the tasks that currently happen as part of startup. I believe Atom could be a lot smarter about that, but I am going to illustrate what and how we could make it so in a separate issue (that is going to supplant the now outdated #13253).

You can notice how Atom now loads `~ 100ms` faster thanks to the minimization of the I/O associated with listing and reading less style sheets; this improvement should also make startup time more consistent across reloads because it will make Atom rely less on the file system.

One thing to note is that we will still need to update `LessCache` and, as a result, write and read from `~/.atom/compile-cache/less` when booting up Atom. We could potentially minimize that cost too by batching reads and writes, but we think we could defer this to later and address other concerns (like packages preloading) first.

Add methods that chose what to save based on focus (instead of the active pane). This behavior change means that pane items in docks (#13977) will be savable too.

### Alternate Designs

The alternate we considered was having a single method which attempted to use the focused pane and then fell back to the active one, however this one was chosen because it's more predictable (i.e. doesn't depend on a state the user may not understand intuitively).

### Benefits

Editors in docks can be saved!

### Possible Drawbacks

Some may be relying on the current behavior, and use the command when an editor isn't active.

language-less and language-sass now use the property names and values in language-css to keep the languages more in sync.  Credit goes to @Alhadis.  Some issues with Sass have been fixed as well (most notably: Sass's custom property-list syntax is now tokenized properly).

Then, at runtime, Atom can simply use this instance and complete its initialization by supplying all the information we didn't have at compile-time: setting the `ATOM_HOME`, reading the user configuration, etc.

You can notice how creating an `AtomEnvironment` is ~2x faster now, as it went down from `~106ms` to `~58ms`.

It's worth noting that just loading the base style sheets took more than `~30ms` (more than half of the `initialize` method). This is due to performing a lot of synchronous I/O but it can be almost eliminated by, again, making use of snapshots and load as much data as possible during `script/build`. This will be addressed in a forthcoming pull request.

Questions/Stuff to Discuss
---------------------------

I have some FIXMEs in the code for questions that came up along the way, as well as some others:

- ~[Is there any good way to detect whether something's droppable in the dock?][1]~
  - Just going to keep the Nuclide check for now and defer blessing anything without knowing the problem more
- ~[There are some known edge cases with showing the toggle buttons on hover.][2] Should we address them?~
  - Going to listen for leaving the central pane area, then handle it with mousemoves/position comparisons
- There's code that remembers the last place you put an item so that, if you close it and later open another, it'll show in the same place.
  - ~[Is trying to remember the split worth it?][3] It's not enough to just do it when a pane is moved (as is currently happening) since another pane moving would affect it. We could abuse `serialize()` and do it there instead. (It shouldn't be in the serialized value though because we want it to be shared across workspaces.) That wouldn't be perfect either though, because if the same item was in different locations in two windows, we wouldn't know which was preferred. (Either way, we're still kinda making a ""best guess"" since split location isn't context-independent.)~
    - Not worth it; leave it out for now
  - ~Is there a more efficient storage mechanism than [putting stringified JSON in local storage][4]?~
    - Use StateStore (this means `openItem()` will have to return a promise)
- ~The open API doesn't currently have a way to ensure a new item is created. (It always searches at least the active pane of the center.) Does that matter?~
  - Going to ignore until we have a use case
- ~Is it weird to have some of the workspace API methods (`paneForURI()`, `paneForItem()`)* include the docks while others (`getActivePane()`) don't? Similarly, if `searchAllPanes` includes docks, what's the desired behavior when `searchAllPanes` is false? (Previously, I mistakenly thought it meant to search no panes, so there wasn't any question.)~
  - `paneForURI()` and `paneForItem()` will include docks; active-related stuff won't. therefore, `searchAllPanes = true` will search docks, `false` (which only checks the active pane) won't
  - a `workspace.getCenter()` will be added and return an instance of the new `WorkspaceCenter` class, which trivially wraps `workspace.paneContainer`

* Oops, looks like I dropped the commit that updated those in a rebase. I'll add them back, depending on how we answer this question.

### Description of the Change

Currently the `--install` flag of the `./script/build` is a boolean flag that either installs atom to some predefined location or skips it. This PR extends the flag so it can accept a value telling the script where to install atom. Passing just `--install` will behave as it used to so far, so it will install atom to `/usr/local` on linux and other default locations on darwin and windows. Same with not passing the flag - atom won't be installed. But passing `--install=/opt/atom` will install atom under the given location.

The documentation is updated accordingly.

### Alternate Designs

I haven't considered other designs, extending the `--install` flag looked natural to me.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

It's a part of the builder script, so it can't be a package.

### Benefits

One can install the code in the location of choice. (Like for flatpaks, we want to install atom under `/app`).

### Possible Drawbacks

It's backward compatible, so not sure if there are drawbacks.

### Applicable Issues

Didn't file any.

13963,25,6,1,Internals,BinaryMuse,2017-03-27T17:56:38Z,292,62,7,18,"This PR addresses https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13873, where the core issue is that re-opening a project when you have a window open with no project folders simply adds those project folders to the existing window, but adding project folders does not restore state for that set of project folders

The primary bad UX that results from this is that re-opening a project from the ""Recent Projects"" menu when you have a fresh Atom window doesn't really restore the previous project state; it just adds those folders to the project and any unsaved work that's stored in the project state is lost, making the user a [sad panda](http://i.imgur.com/Ddd4lWp.jpg).

This addresses the problem by simply restoring the project state for a folder or set of folders when:

1. The folders are added via ""Add Project Folders,"" or the folders are added automatically via the ""Open"" menu or via the `atom` command,
2. The folders are being added to an Atom window in which there are zero project folders

This results in [happier pandas](http://i.imgur.com/xlgcLBy.gif).

**Edge Cases**

‚úÖ  The Atom window has no project folders but already contains pane items

In this case, we serialize all the current pane items, restore the saved state from the snapshot, and then re-add the serialized pane items to the new workspace. We skip unchanged, empty editors (ones with no changes and with no content, like the one you get when ""Open Empty Editor On Start"" is enabled), so in the case that the user opens a new window and immediately re-opens a previously open project, the right thing should Just Happen‚Ñ¢. It's automagical! üåà 

![restore-project-state-with-open-items](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/189606/23728621/b0ad6402-0412-11e7-96f2-c4714c63ec9b.gif)

TODO:

- [ ] Don't ask the user to save or discard the changes
- [ ] Make the currently active pane item the active pane item after the state is restored (unless the user specifically opened a file, in which case that file will be active post-restore)

‚ùå  The Atom window has pane items that ""conflict"" with ones in the state snapshot

If the user already has a file open with unsaved changes, and that same file is open in the saved state snapshot, then the result of the operation is that there will be two copies of the file open, each backed by a different buffer.

This is super edge-casey as it's kinda hard to get into this state (since opening a file adds its parent folder to the project automatically), so I'm not sure if it's one we need to address. üí≠ s appreciated.

TODO:

- [ ] ???

‚ùå  Using `project.setPaths` or `project.addPath` does not trigger this behavior

Right now, the code paths for ""Application: Add Project Folder"" and for opening a file with the ""Open"" command or with `atom` go through code path that `project.setPaths` and `project.addPath` do not. We opted not to change that behavior since it would be a breaking change.

**Design Considerations**

It turns out that serializing a text editor and then deserializing it into a new `AtomEnvironment` is not very straightforward. The sorta hacky solution implemented here so far is to:

1. Serialize all the current pane items (text editors)
2. Also serialize all the buffers in `@project.buffers`
3. Restore the serialized `AtomEnvironment` state (minus window size and fullscreen setting)
4. Push the serialized buffers from step 2 into the new `@project.buffers`
5. Deserialize the serialized pane items from step 1

This feels üôÖ pretty gross üôÖ but we're not quite sure of a better way to handle it. üí≠ s from @atom/core highly appreciated!

1. Exposing load settings to `BrowserWindow`s as JSON.

    When accessing objects in the main process via the `remote` module, Electron returns proxy objects that are references to the original ones. This means that trying to access a remote object's property or function results in a synchronous message exchange with the main process. <br>

    In Atom core we frequently access the load settings coming from the main process, especially during startup. This caused a lot of synchronous I/O which was blocking the renderer process for several milliseconds.
  
    With this pull request, instead of exposing load settings as a JavaScript object, we serialize them to JSON in the main process and parse them back to a JavaScript object in the renderer processes. This allows us to get a full copy of the object locally and pay for I/O only once when retrieving load settings from the main process for the first time.

2. Disabling zoom in the main process rather than in the renderer process.

    With this pull request we will register the `display-added` and `display-removed` events only once in the main process in order to disable zoom (see
    #11345) directly instead of unnecessarily paying for I/O in the renderer process during startup.

3. Registering enter/leave fullscreen events in the main process rather than in the renderer process.

    This will still notify render processes when such events are triggered without, however, incurring the additional cost of synchronously retrieving a `BrowserWindow` (and its properties) via `remote` during startup.

4. Replacing `localStorage` with `StateStore` in `HistoryManager`.

    Instead of using `localStorage` to store and retrieve the project history, with this pull request we will use `StateStore` so that we can retrieve state asynchronously without blocking Atom during startup. @damieng: I think this slightly changes the public `clearProjects` API by making it asynchronous. Considering the recent introduction of the API and its low adoption (I couldn't find anyone using it in packages), I believe this might be negligible; if you have any concern about it, though, please don't hesitate to raise them up.

These improvements are particularly evident during the construction of an `AtomEnvironment` instance. This is how a typical chart of that code path looks like today on master:

![screen shot 2017-03-07 at 11 10 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23651715/ae6bb898-0326-11e7-9059-22eb4bdd7f9a.png)

After removing all the synchronous I/O, the same code path looks like the following:

![screen shot 2017-03-07 at 11 05 29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23651745/c4b1626a-0326-11e7-990e-cb9962520920.png)

On average, with these changes we save `~ 40ms` for the construction of `AtomEnvironment`. Moreover, the experience should be snappier across all the code paths because we won't pay any additional cost to retrieve load settings and to save project history state anymore. 

The next step will involve building an `AtomEnvironment` instance right inside the snapshot (as opposed to doing so at runtime) and thus potentially save 80-90% of the remaining `~ 80ms` observed after the changes introduced by this pull request.

### Description of the Change

`src/config-schema.js`: the change adds the option to the Settings window.

`src/main-process/atom-application.coffee`:
- line 114: load previous session if the option is turned on;
- line 563: IMO it's a bug, here the newly created window is activated, but `@lastFocusedWindow` is not updated, so on the second invocation at the same moment in time there'll be no lastFocusedWindow and a second (new) window would be created (at line 542/544 -> 550/552).
- line 604: if any of the options is checked, restore the last session (applicable when starting atom without arguments)
- line 817: a function to duplicate an object, taken from: https://coffeescript-cookbook.github.io/chapters/classes_and_objects/cloning

### Alternate Designs

TL;DR: none, see the issue #9643 for an extended discussion.


### Why Should This Be In Core?

This is a standard behavior for most of modern multi-tab apps today, i.e. the ability to restore the last session after crash or normal exit, no matter how the app is invoked for the first time since the last session (i.e. with or without path parameters).


### Benefits

See the previous point.


### Possible Drawbacks

None as this is an option turned off by default, so it won't affect anyone if not explicitly terned on by the user.


### Applicable Issues

So far no issues were discovered.


### Other

With this commit we slice the array before iterating over it so that destroying a `PanelContainer` doesn't throw exceptions anymore.

What we realized at the time was that most of the operations happening during startup were redundant and that we could use the information we had at build-time to minimize their cost.

### V8 snapshots

[V8 snapshots](https://v8project.blogspot.it/2015/09/custom-startup-snapshots.html) allow Electron applications to execute an arbitrary JavaScript file and output a binary file containing a heap with all the data that's left in memory after running a GC at the end of the provided script.

This suits the startup scenario described above perfectly, because we could use it to eagerly perform work when running `script/build` and just expose the computed data to Atom when it is opened.

The tricky part of using snapshots is that the code is executed in a bare V8 context, meaning that we have no access to Node/Electron features nor to DOM APIs and we can only run plain JavaScript code without having access to native modules either. So, in order to circumvent this issue, we decided to defer usages of forbidden APIs until runtime so that all the other computation could still happen as part of the snapshot. As a result, we set out to create a tool that automates deferring the usage such features in a way that didn't sacrifice code readability: electron-link.

### electron-link

[electron-link](https://github.com/atom/electron-link) is node module that takes a JavaScript file as the entry point and a list of modules that need to be required lazily. Then, starting from the main module, it traverses the entire require graph, replacing all the forbidden requires in each file with a function that will be executed later at runtime. The output of electron-link is a file that can be passed to the `mksnapshot` utility to eventually generate the snapshot blob for use in Electron.

electron-link can also determine whether a module can be snapshotted or not. For instance, the following code can be snapshotted:

```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = function () {
  return path.join('a', 'b', 'c')
}
```

And the resulting code would look similar to the following snippet:

```js
let path;
function get_path () {
  return path || path = require('path');
}

module.exports = function () {
  return get_path().join('a', 'b', 'c')
}
```

Conversely, when trying to transform the following code, electron-link will throw an error because it is using a forbidden module at require-time:

```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = path.join('a', 'b', 'c')
```

### Improving `require` time

While this pull request lays the groundwork for using snapshots for all the concerns described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13253, it only speeds up the time we were previously spending in `require` calls. The reason for beginning with just this one feature is that it will allow us to verify the feasibility of snapshots in production and to ship new performance improvements incrementally.

The following is a typical chart of Atom startup time:

![screen shot 2017-03-02 at 12 02 49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23504533/348fb306-ff40-11e6-8bac-264060588ce5.png)

*Please, note that these benchmarks profile everything from startup till the end of packages activation. There is other stuff going on after activating packages but it depends on asynchronous I/O and the scheduling of idle callbacks, so it adds noise to the measurements.*

On average it takes `~ 0.9s - 1.0s` to load a stock Atom window and activate its packages when no editor is open and the tree-view is closed. A lot of it is spent in requiring modules and executing them to create classes or define objects. This is how the same chart looks like after this pull request:

![screen shot 2017-03-02 at 12 01 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23504534/34b323ea-ff40-11e6-8f19-462592b0eb42.png)

You can notice how the calls to `require` have almost disappeared (some still need to take place for Node core modules) and how the total time has went down to `~ 0.7s - 0.8s` improving startup time by ~ 15-20%.

Another scenario worth of comparison is loading an Atom window with the tree-view opened. This is how it looks like on **master**:

![screen shot 2017-03-02 at 12 11 24](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23504869/886dbbb6-ff41-11e6-8d00-63e62857e79b.png)

You can see it was `~ 100ms - 120ms` slower and, in part, this is due to loading the package's modules. With the snapshot, on the other hand, we already paid that cost upfront during `script/build` and therefore the chart looks almost the same in terms of time (we still incur some overhead due to accessing the disk synchronously in the tree-view, but that's another story):

![screen shot 2017-03-02 at 12 12 14](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/23504870/8891088c-ff41-11e6-9b66-cc2a3c2e9741.png)

This kind of improvement should apply to all the bundled packages because they are now required during the snapshotting phase.

### Caveats

Please, note that this pull request disables the asar bundle. Its introduction was mainly driven by two factors:

1. Lots of file system calls to stat the files.
2. Long path issues on Windows.

The former will be automatically addressed by snapshots because most of the fs calls will now happen during `script/build`, whereas the latter was solved by upgrading to npm 3 back in #11897.

Another caveat is that all the code that is snapshotted won't be inspectable in the DevTools, although stack traces should still be present and provide clear information about the call site where the error was thrown from.

### Next steps

Overall, we are really excited about snapshots and we think we can further improve startup time by performing even more work during `script/build`. This could include eagerly constructing an `AtomEnvironment`, parsing grammars and snippets, loading and parsing less style sheets, etc.

Also, before merging this there are a couple of additional tasks that need to be addressed:

* [x] Merge https://github.com/atom/fs-plus/pull/37.
* [x] Merge https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher/pull/119.
* [x] Clean up `shouldExcludeModule` and remove unnecessarily excluded modules.

Much nicer.

Changes include:
* Updating to the new `.<anonymous>` syntax
* Stripping away `file:///` identifiers on Windows paths and converting the rest of the path to use Windows path separators (in order for it to get relativized correctly)
* Relativizing paths in parentheses

### Alternate Designs

Instead of relativizing the path twice, depending on if its in parentheses or not, a more general `line.replace(///#{_.escapeRegExp(spec.specDirectory}#{_.escapeRegExp(path.sep}///, '')` could be used.  I am unsure if that would potentially relativize more than we wanted.

13820,2,31,0,Internals,maxbrunsfeld,2017-02-15T21:54:16Z,104,2,4,0,"Fixes #979

#### Changes:
1. We force soft wraps for lines that exceed 500 chars. This avoids the rendering bottleneck that we used to experience because we don't break lines into horizontal tiles. It's actually a pretty useful behavior, I think, because a single un-wrapped line of code is pretty hard to read.

2. We don't pass more than 500 chars at a time to first-mate. There was already a limit to the number of tokens that we read from first-mate, but because the TextMate grammars can contain regexps with arbitrary lookahead and backtracking requirements, this token limit did not mitigate all of the performance problems of tokenizing large lines. Now we avoid passing more than 500 characters of text at a time to the tokenizer.

#### Benchmark results

We added a benchmark for opening large single-line files. When run agains Atom *prior* to this PR, this benchmark would basically not terminate üò¨ . Now, it executes in a reasonable amount of time:

```
Opening a large single-line file:
512	1442.5700000000002
1024	2813.6100000000006
2048	5145.779999999995

Max time event loop was blocked after opening a large single-line file:
512	14.859999999999673
1024	8.095000000001164
2048	5.575000000004366

Clicking the editor after opening a large single-line file:
512	6.609999999999673
1024	3.9499999999970896
2048	4.955000000001746

Scrolling down after opening a large single-line file:
512	0.18499999999949068
1024	0.05000000000291038
2048	0.05000000000291038
```

You can see that the editor is immediately responsive after opening the file, regardless of its size. Unfortunately, the time to open a large single-line file still scales linearly with the size of the file. This is because the `DisplayLayer` currently indexes files on a line-wise basis, so for a single-line file, it has to index the entire file to answer any queries.

Still, a reasonably-sized minified file like [jQuery 3.1.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js) (85 kb, 4 lines), opens almost instantly üéâ .

Don't soft wrap mini editors.  It seems like this isn't really useful for mini editors.

### Alternate Designs

### Description of the Change

### Alternate Designs

I am not aware of an alternative approach.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

Since the modified API for searching is part of the core it needs to be extended to support the use case described in atom/find-and-replace#190. If the `find-and-replace` package could handle this without requiring modifications to the core that would be great but with the current API being provided by the core I don't think this is possible.

### Benefits

It implements the long desired feature described in atom/find-and-replace#190.

### Possible Drawbacks

The additional optional argument shouldn't result in any backward compatibility problem as far as I can tell.

### Applicable Issues / Remaining Todos

* ~~In the current state when the search results list a file which is not opened yet and you click on the result the match is being updated and looses the context information. This is due to the fact that the search is being repeated in the buffer (instead of using `scandal` through the workspace API. In order to address this the `TextBuffer.scan` needs to be extended to support the same new options as in the referenced `scandal` ticket. Therefore I have prefixed the title with `[WIP]` for now.~~ This has been address with the PR to the `text-buffer` package.

When all the selections are destroyed and someone calls `editor.getLastSelection`, Atom ensures there is at least one selection available and, as a result, creates a new one. Due to the way our code was structured, the `onDidAddCursor` event was being fired before the new selection had the chance to be stored in the editor state: as a result, when someone tried to call `editor.getLastSelection` during a ""cursor added"" event, Atom would retry to create a selection, thus firing again the `onDidAddCursor` event and causing the infinite loop.

This pull request fixes the above problem by emitting the `did-add-cursor` event after the selection has been successfully added to the editor state.

### Description of the Change

I updated the list of text encodings that appear in the Settings configuration menu to properly reflect the code pages supported by [encoding-selector](https://github.com/atom/encoding-selector), as well as present descriptive text for the selection menu.

In the process, I removed what appeared to be a duplicate entry ('iso88597').

### Alternate Designs

None considered. I based the syntax on the code below it (the Telemetry selection options).

### Why Should This Be In Core?

It's a more user-friendly presentation of the list of supported code pages.

### Benefits

Users may more easily recognize the available text encodings that Atom supports from the Settings configuration page. 

### Possible Drawbacks

The code may break the functionality of the menu, because I'm not aware of how the menus are constructed, to be honest. I presume a more experienced coder can figure this out.

This regression was introduced with the removal of the shadow DOM from `<atom-text-editor>` elements. Previously we were relying on Chrome always reporting `<atom-text-editor>` as the mousewheel `event.target`. As a result, removing the shadow boundary caused the mousewheel event to be potentially dispatched from anywhere inside the editor element, making our previous logic for handling ctrl-mousewheel invalid.

This pull request fixes it by recognizing mousewheel events that are dispatched from within an editor.

1. Introduces an `isConnected` flag to `state-store`.

In the common (for me) case where you open e.g. beta after you've opened stable, and beta fails to connect to the indexedDB, it's set false.

2. Checks `atom.stateStore.isConnected` when determining whether to prompt to save file changes. Without this, changes are silently lost in this scenario.

Unfortunately there are a few [edge cases](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10208#issuecomment-248550174) that would make the UI look broken. It's something that a [package](https://atom.io/packages/no-title-bar), theme or `styles.less` could provide when `custom-inset` is used.

Another example with the `tool-bar` package taking the role of a ""title bar"":

![title-bar-custom 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/18807177/79a71afc-827b-11e6-8bc9-68ec69338e59.png)


### Why Should This Be In Core?

Needs access to the `BrowserWindow` API.


### Benefits

- Provides more title-bar variations.
- Themes can adapt to the different title-bar modes. Before there was no way to tell.
- Allows packages/themes to customize even further, like hide the title-bar but keep the traffic lights.


### Possible Drawbacks

When hiding the title-bar, managing the window needs to be done with the keyboard or from the menu. Dragging the window needs to be done with the status-bar. Not really a drawback since it's a choice and not the default.


### Applicable Issues

This PR contiues from https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10208 (Hide title bar on OS X) and https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11790 (already merged).

The [dalek package](https://github.com/atom/dalek) checks after Atom activates the initial set of packages to see if there are packages that are installed both as built-in packages and as community packages. When people install built-in packages as community packages (often to get ""the latest version"") because built-in packages are designed to work with a specific version of Atom, strange bugs can happen that are very hard to diagnose. The dalek packages detects this problematic situation and notifies the person running Atom, giving them the information they need to correct the situation.

This pull request fixes a subtle bug that prevented hooks from being triggered on packages that were activated *after* Atom's initialization. In particular, when installing or disabling/enabling a package that relied on the `core:loaded-shell-environment` hook, such package would never activate because the hook had already been triggered.

This problem was not specific to `core:loaded-shell-environment`: in facts, the `grammar-used` hook was affected by it as well, although it was less evident because a `grammar-used` hook is emitted every time a new file is opened, rather than just once as it happens for `core:loaded-shell-environment`.

With this pull request, when a package is activated (either after installing it or after re-enabling it) we will re-trigger all the activation hooks that have been triggered until that moment. In addition, after a package has been successfully activated, we will stop listening to further activation (hooks and commands) events for that specific package.

One unfortunate side effect is that when you right click on an element, the dom mutations to highlight the element have not been flushed yet which makes for a very bad user experience https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2991

In order to solve this issue, we would like to flush the mutations and only then display the menu. Unfortunately, electron doesn't have APIs for that.

Things I have tried:
1) Electron has `browserWindow.webContents.invalidate()` and `.on('paint' -> ...)` but it only works with offscreen rendering which     atom doesn't use.
2) `.capturePage(-> ...)` takes a screenshot of the page and I hoped it     would do a flush first but it inconsistently displays the highlight     so it won't work.
3) `Using setTimeout((-> ...), 16)` works many times but not always
4) `requestAnimationFrame(-> ...)` should be what we want but unfortunately     it doesn't always show the highlights :(

What I found worked was to nest three `requestAnimationFrame`, it works all the time even when my machine is busy. This is not a 100% solution but I think that it's okay to assume that if the highlight hasn't been updated in three frames then you should probably try and optimize your code. 3 frames is 50ms and that delay isn't noticeable.

Note: the proper way to solve this that was mentioned in the issue is to open the menu from the main process but this is already what atom does and it's still an issue.

When Atom is launched from the Dock, we invoke the user shell to retrieve environment variables that are assigned by their profile settings. However, we were doing so synchronously during startup, thus causing a [major slowdown](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9406) when opening Atom from the Dock and sometimes [hanging the startup process indefinitely](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13084).

With this pull request, we are changing `updateProcessEnv` into an asynchronous method. Packages that require shell environment variables to be assigned prior to activation can use the new `core:loaded-shell-environment` activation hook by putting the following snippet in `package.json`:

```json
{""activationHooks"": [""core:loaded-shell-environment""]}
```

This will defer packages' activation until `process.env` has been updated with the user environment variables.

The current description of the `core.openEmptyEditorOnStart` is misleading which has caused a lot of confusion around what this option is supposed to do or not do. Many people change this setting expecting some behavior difference when they start Atom the next time only to find out that it doesn't do anything from what they can tell. This is because Atom's default behavior in the absence of other instructions is to restore the state from the last time Atom was open, completely ignoring this setting.

There is [a way to configure Atom to not restore the last state](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11324). The configuration setting was never exposed in the config schema though so people had to dig through the code or search through Issues and PRs to discover that it was an option. This change adds the `core.restorePreviousWindowsOnStart` setting to the schema so that is no longer necessary.

### Alternate Designs

A more [comprehensive overhaul of Atom's launch story](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10517) whether in one large change or multiple small ones is something that is being looked at but won't realistically solve this confusion in the near term.

### Why Should This Be In Core?

This isn't new functionality.

### Benefits

A more clear understanding of what these settings do and do not.

### Possible Drawbacks

If not adding the `core.restorePreviousWindowsOnStart` setting to the config schema was intentional, this has the obvious drawback that it is now showing up in the Settings View.

All icons should be fine except that the `GitHub` wordmark is much smaller. We can update the font size in places where we use that icon, like on the About page. The ""Gist"" icon is also quite small, but since it's a new one, it hasn't been used anywhere.

13101,23,33,21,Internals,BinaryMuse,2016-11-01T16:58:02Z,337,3,5,2,"This is a ~~WIP and (thus far) rough~~ implementation of per-package transpilation pipelines mentioned in #13087. It allows packages to opt in to fully managing their own transpilation steps, bypassing the built-in Atom transpilation entirely. Here's roughly how it works:
1. A package declares a property in its `package.json` called `atomTranspilers`. This is an array of objects, with each object specifying `glob`, `transpiler`, and optionally `options`.
2. When a package is loaded, if `atomTranspilers` exists in its metadata, we notify the `CompileCache` that it wants to do its own compilation.
3. A new class called `PackageTranspilationRegistry` wraps all the `CompileCache` compilers with a new object of the same interface that falls back to the original compiler if a package hasn't opted in to its own transpilation, but bypasses it completely otherwise.
4. If a package is doing it's own compilation, then for each file that matches the `glob` specified, the associated `transpiler` is required, and the exported value should be an object with a function called `compile` that takes three arguments: `sourceCode`, `filePath`, and `options` (where `options` comes from the package's `package.json`). It should return a string or Buffer with the transpiled source, or `undefined` to indicate that it doesn't want to transpile that file. Note that returning `undefined` doesn't fall back to the legacy, core behavior ‚Äî¬†packages which opt in to this mechanism are _fully_ responsible for _all_ their transpilation.

Also worth noting is that the transpiler file cannot be transpiled itself; its source must run in a vanilla Atom environment (which is admittedly pretty capable these days :).

One question I have is how to handle the caching. For example, I currently have `getCachePath` set to

``` javascript
return path.join(
  ""package-transpile"",
  crypto
    .createHash('sha1')
    .update(transpilerSource, 'utf8')
    .update(sourceCode, 'utf8')
    .digest('hex')
  )
```

but in many cases it's possible that neither the file's source nor the transpiler's source has changed, but the output of transpilation would be different (e.g. when editing a `.babelrc` file). Perhaps we should allow the package author to also specify a cache key for the file?

This code:

``` coffee
scope = @editor.scopeDescriptorForBufferPosition([start, 0])
commentStrings = @editor.getCommentStrings(scope)
```

Returns `Object {commentStartString: undefined, commentEndString: undefined}` if the language doesn't have comments. For example with `text.plain.null-grammar`.

Which causes this check in `LanguageMode.toggleLineCommentsForBufferRows`

``` coffee
return unless commentStrings?
```

To not return. Meaning `LanguageMode.toggleLineCommentsForBufferRows` will run even when there is no comment defined for the current language.
Which means that if the line is empty and the language doesn't have a defined comment we print `undefined` in the `TextEditor`.

This PR adds a check to return early if there is no `commentStartString`.
### Alternate Designs

Change the return value to `null` instead of returning an object with `undefined` properties for languages with no defined comments.
### Benefits
1. Fixes bug!
2. Doesn't write `undefined` in the `TextEditor` when trying comment an empty line when the comment is `undefined`!
3. Adds a test to not regress!

Because the newer versions of Chromium (v52 in Atom v1.12.0-beta4) we're using in the current versions of Atom support all of the critical pieces of ES6, the `--harmony` flag is no longer necessary. Since the `--harmony` flag was the only flag set in that function, I also removed the `setupJavascriptArguments` function and the one call to the function.
### Alternate Designs

v1.4.x of Electron, which is based on Chromium v53, doesn't suffer from the bug that the `--harmony` flag exposes. Our [Electron v1.4 update PR](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12696) is still not quite ready to merge, so we decided to just remove the flag.
### Benefits

People won't experience random crashes when executing async code in Atom v1.12.x and above.
### Possible Drawbacks

There may be some packages that rely on features provided by `--harmony` that aren't available in the vanilla JavaScript support in Chromium or less likely aren't available in Atom's Babel support.

- `application:reopen-project` command that provides a search across all projects opened
- `application:clear-project-history` command to clear project history
## Notes
- For now you can type `atom.history.importProjectHistory()` in the debug window to build your initial list from Atom's internal window-state history. Am considering making this happen automatically when you first run Atom with no existing project history state file.
- Multiple folder projects appear in the menu as the last name in the paths separated by a comma e.g. 'atom, settings-view' for width. They appear in full in the pop-up palette.
- Reopening a project always appears in a new window as window-state is preserved between projects and it is quite jarring otherwise.
- 'Clear Project History' appears at the top of the menu instead of ideally at the bottom due to limitations of the MenuManager and how it handles separators. Will be addressed in the future once that is resolved.
- Setting `core.reopenProjectMenuCount` does not disable the menu right now because of the same limitations as above (removing at run-time refuses to remove the separator)

Until now we have been relying solely on Chrome's wonderful profiler to explain performance optimizations or regressions when opening pull requests or issues; however, even though DevTools are a great companion when it comes to understanding what's slow and why, we felt the need for a sharper tool that could allow everyone (not just the person opening the pull request) to:
- Run benchmarks on their machine.
- Easily compare and contrast two runs of the same exact benchmark on two different versions of Atom.
- Store benchmarks and keep track of them.

As part of our efforts to make performance in Atom better and more transparent, we are introducing `Window: Run Benchmarks` and `atom --benchmark`.

_Disclaimer: this feature is meant to be used exclusively for atom/atom and, although it could work, we recommend against using it for running benchmarks on packages._
### A quick tour

When opening the command palette, you can now invoke the `Window: Run Benchmarks` command. This will open a new window and run all the benchmarks found in the `benchmarks/` directory. As soon as a benchmark completes, a plot of its data will be displayed on screen:

![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 12 08 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/19383899/e740b790-9206-11e6-84e3-80a36bf1d2ae.png)

Alternatively, you can invoke `atom --benchmark` with one or more benchmark paths and get textual output instead:

```
Opening and rendering a TextEditor in large file mode:

0   199.98000000000002
1   18.894999999999982
2   11.099999999999909
3   9.565000000000055
4   8.554999999999836
5   9.670000000000073
```

You might have noticed that the above output is formatted as CSV (i.e. there is a tab between the columns). This allows to import data into an external tool like Numbers.app pretty easily to e.g. perform comparisons between two or more versions of Atom:

![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 12 30 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/19384533/f7a7ef2e-9209-11e6-8463-f39b9dbea513.png)

Or to switch to a different representation of the same data:

""Single-value"" benchmarks are also supported, and they will not show any graph when run through `Window: Run benchmarks`:

![screen shot 2016-10-14 at 12 52 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/19385086/1d6824f6-920d-11e6-9c28-e25076b67395.png)
### Implementation details

Data is plotted via [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js) and each benchmark is a javascript file (named `*.bench.js`) that exports a function (synchronous or asynchronous) with the following signature:

``` js
// `test` is a boolean indicating whether the user wants to run benchmarks in a
// lightweight mode.
export default function ({test}) {
  const t0 = window.performance.now()
  fun1()
  const t1 = window.performance.now()
  fun1()
  const t2 = window.performance.now()
  fun2()
  const t3 = window.performance.now()

  // This will plot one graph for `fun-1` and one ""single-value"" benchmark for
  // `fun-2`. Note how the latter doesn't need to supply an `x` value in the
  // object.
  return [
    {name: 'fun-1', x: 1, duration: t1 - t0},
    {name: 'fun-1', x: 2, duration: t2 - t1},
    {name: 'fun-2', duration: t3 - t2}
  ]
}
```

It's also interesting to note that, for the time being, we will not run benchmarks on dedicated hardware. However, we will make sure that they won't become stale or out-of-date by running a more lightweight version of them (see the `test` parameter above) on CI via `atom --benchmark-test` (which, with this pull request, will be executed as part of `script/test`).

Fixes the bug described in issue #11848

## Fix

From what I explored it looks like a previous dev has tried to fix this bug. Although because rows are 0 indexed, to select the penultimate row for the range it requires using `-2`. 

I wonder whether it's worth rewriting the line:

``` coffeescript
lines += '\n' unless lines[lines.length - 1] is '\n'
```

I've attempted to add a valid test. Suggestions to improve or better represent the test welcome üò∏

In reality, we still need to construct `TokenizedLine` instances when `TokenizedBuffer.prototype.tokenizedLineForRow` is called because we want to construct some synthetic null grammar boundaries so that `TokenizedBufferIterator` doesn't iterate till the end of the buffer (regression), and also because other packages are currently relying on that API. In practice this should be pretty cheap, because in the majority of the cases it happens only for lines that are currently on screen.

Back in #3943, we started rendering text editor contents inside a shadow DOM boundary to prevent outer style sheets from altering the editor inner contents. Although this introduced many benefits, it carried several tradeoffs too.

In particular, we started duplicating some of the style sheets (`{context: 'atom-text-editor'}`) inside each shadow root so that package and theme authors could still be able to explicitly target the editor visual elements. An alternative solution to this problem that we suggested (before the shadow DOM spec was finalized) was to use `/deep/` and `::shadow` pseudo selectors, which unfortunately are now [being deprecated](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=489954).

Even more importantly, this architecture was getting in the way of making `atom-text-editor` a reusable component, because it made it even more coupled to Atom and its ecosystem. Other problems involved things like #4590, and a more complex user experience for package and theme authors in general. Ultimately, we started feeling like the extra complexity of the shadow DOM wasn't worth its benefits.
### Removing shadow DOM from `atom-text-editor`

This pull request aims at removing the shadow DOM in a way that prevents elements within `atom-text-editor` that we don't fully control (i.e. the grammar scopes applied as CSS classes to every line's inner `<span>`) from being mistakenly styled from the outside. Specifically, every syntactic class name will now be prepended with `syntax--`; styling a JavaScript operator, for example, should now look like the following:

``` css
.syntax--source.syntax--js .syntax--operator {
  color: green;
}
```

Given the wide scope of this change, we are trying to reduce package breakage to a minimum by [transforming deprecated selectors automatically](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/as-deprecate-shadow-dom/src/style-manager.js#L251-L306) and emitting a deprecation in [deprecation-cop](https://github.com/atom/deprecation-cop). Applying these transformations can be quite onerous and therefore we have introduced a layer of caching in 07d56b2 to ensure their performance impact stays low after the first time Atom is launched. 

Other notable changes include:
- Block decorations rendering has been rewritten from scratch (it previously worked only with the shadow DOM).
- When the editor is focused, `document.activeElement` will now return the hidden `<input>` inside `atom-text-editor`, instead of `atom-text-editor` itself. I could find only one third party package relying on this behavior, and I am going to submit a pull request shortly to use `document.activeElement.closest('atom-text-editor')` instead.
- Any Grim or style sheet deprecation will now cause specs to fail, see [`ensureNoDeprecatedFunctionCalls`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/as-deprecate-shadow-dom/spec/spec-helper.coffee#L121) and [`ensureNoDeprecatedStylesheets`](ensureNoDeprecatedStylesheets).
- Rendering flashes for decorations has been broken for a long time, but removing the shadow DOM highlighted the cause of the issue, and so they have been fixed in 1091b0e.

### Conclusion

Removing the shadow DOM is an important step for the editor's future, as doing so will allow us to extract it, clean it up and optimize it. Considering the invasive nature of this change, we are planning to :ship: it after rolling the railcars next week, so that everyone can build it from master and extensively test it for an entire release cycle.

This has only one major drawback - community packages which still use the old style need to be updated in a similar fashion, so before making a major release, we should give enough time for package developers to ensure their packages work with the new version. Most of the time it is fixable by adding a `@` in front of the parameter variable name. Inevitably this will also introduce issues like ""the new version broke package xyz"".

For Atom packages I used [coffeescope2](https://github.com/za-creature/coffeescope) with following configuration (add into `coffeelint.json`).

``` json
  ""check_scope"": {

Undefined identifier is potentially the problematic spot you will want to fix. In my case the following change was enough: https://github.com/atom/open-on-github/commit/1f19165cadec324a6f300e371ebfe3b72898e1fd

After that it is up to you whether you want to keep using coffeescope2 or not, but it should help avoiding the most common issue that comes with this CoffeeScript update. Using coffeescope2 after this procedure is completely optional.

**One extra note as I see people copying this configuration to their projects. Some of very useful functionality of coffeescope2 has been disabled in this configuration, so that we could focus on fixing the current issue. You are missing out on quite a bit (namely detection of unused variables, variable overwriting and shadowing), you might want to take a look at it by enabling the flags in configuration.**

This PR includes a new version of `atom-keymap` with changes described in https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap/pull/144.

The basic idea is that we will never shadow the ability to type an ASCII character with any key binding. Most of this logic is handled in `atom-keymap` and is describe in the above PR.

In addition to the keymap changes, we are forced to omit keyboard shortcuts for application menu items if there's a possibility they could interfere with typing `AltGraph`-modified characters on international layouts. This means that `alt-` bindings on Mac and `ctrl-alt-` bindings on Windows won't show up in the menu, but the bindings will still work so long as they don't conflict.

I'd appreciate it if international users could give this a try by downloading binaries from the build provider for their platform. You can find links to builds of this PR in the build status section at the bottom of this page, then navigate to the ""artifacts"" section:

This implements the plan we described in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10297#issuecomment-245997900. This means that Nuclide's `atom.directory-provider` service hook will be called earlier in Atom's startup process, before project deserialization and notably before Nuclide's `activate` method is called. It also means that custom `Directory` instances for which `.existsSync()` returns `false` will _not_ be added to the project, so you may need to handle the state where the user has not yet authenticated specially in that method.

Also note that the `atom.directory-provider` service must be specified in Nuclide's top-level package.json (rather than being registered dynamically) in order to be recognized.

Sorry for requiring you to make these changes, but we really need to fix #10297, which was introduced by changes that we made together in order to accommodate Nuclide in the first place, so it doesn't seem too unreasonable.

Here's the problem as I understand it now: when you call `PaneContainer::destroy()`, it destroys all of its Panes. Each Pane will notify its PaneAxis, which will then remove the Pane from its list of children. This all works as long as the container's root is a PaneAxis, however, when you go from 2 to 1 Panes, the PaneAxis will reparent the last Pane making it the container's root. From that point on, `PaneContainer::getPanes()` will delegate to [the (destroyed) Pane](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/v1.11.0-beta5/src/pane.coffee), which returns a list that includes itself.

My gut says that the right way to address this is to never have a Pane be the root (e.g. always contain it in a PaneAxis) but I don't really know.

This pull-request is a first step towards such solution: instead of using Travis and AppVeyor as build-only providers, we will now run main process tests on them. These kind of tests are more coarse-grained than the renderer process ones, but they provide quick feedback and should act as good smoke tests for when we release new versions. We could have used `chromedriver` as well, but it seems like it's quite flaky on both Windows and Linux, so I have put that on hold for the time being (in a later pull-request, it might be interesting to change our current `smoke-spec` to use [electron/spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron) instead and see if that changes anything).

Previously, when calling `TokenizedBufferIterator.seek` with a position that lied within a text tag, we advanced the iterator by the extent of that tag without, however, consuming it. Hence, when calling `moveToSuccessor` afterward, we would consume that tag and advance the iterator again, thus effectively moving it twice and causing issues like the aforementioned one.

An option could be to clip to the left of the textual tag without consuming it. However, this would be a little odd with respect to the current contract of (`DisplayLayer` and) `seek`, whose promise is to move the iterator to a position that is greater or equal than the one asked by the caller.

Therefore, with this pull-request, we are changing the behavior of `seek` in this particular scenario to consume the tag in question and process all its siblings until a tag boundary is finally found. This ensures that the above contract is always respected, while still preserving the ""seek to leftmost tag boundary"" semantics (i.e. notice how in the changed test case, calling `seek` with `Point(0, 1)` is the same as calling it with `Point(0, 3)`).

In the previous build scripts, we were considering all the builds triggered by a pull-request to be part of the dev channel. We adopted the same heuristic for the new build scripts, but didn't notice that Travis always sets the `TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST` variable to ""false"" (which causes the `process.env.TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST` expression to be evaluated as truthy).

In the past, this wasn't a problem because we were building artifacts via Janky, but after switching to Travis this makes it generate the wrong assets on stable and beta.

To fix this, it seems reasonable to remove the conditional that checks if we are building a pull-request: in the past this could have been problematic because assets could be uploaded inadvertently to S3 or GitHub, but this should be safe now that we rely on the release publisher to perform that task.

Refs #12445 

This pull-request is a proposal to introduce an `autoWidth` parameter on `TextEditor` instances. When instantiating an editor with this parameter, the `width` of the `<atom-text-editor>` element will be automatically adjusted to the width of its content (+ the width of the gutter, if present).

![autowidth](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/17744937/27e4ed64-64aa-11e6-92cf-6214fcb32847.gif)

Since we explicitly assign a `width` to text editors that have enabled `autoWidth`, there's no need to resort to CSS hacks on the parent component (e.g. `style.minWidth = '1em'`) or on the element itself (i.e. `display: inline-block`). This option will be off by default, meaning that editors will inherit the parent element's width, exactly like a `display: block` element. Because this will be an opt-in behavior it shouldn't introduce any regression and, thus, we might hot-fix stable and beta (respectively 1.9 and 1.10, as of this pull-request) with this new parameter.

Unfortunately, DOM APIs are insufficient to make this determination in a complete way, leading to unpredictable behavior.

This PR deprecates the automatic determination of this behavior. By default, editors base their height on their content. If an editor has an explicit height assigned via its style or is positioned absolute with an explicit top and bottom, we disable the content-based height calculation and log a deprecation warning telling the user to assign `autoHeight` explicitly in the future.

This paves the way to add an `autoWidth` setting to address https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12441, which will default to `false` but be overridable in this same way.

We intend to move this PR through the entire release cycle because it's a pretty big change, then open a separate PR for the more additive `autoWidth` setting that we can hotfix to 1.9.x to fix Nuclide's issue without as much risk.

Tasks:
- [x] Deprecate automatic auto-height determination and get tests green
- [x] Ensure we only issue one deprecation warning per editor
- [x] Add test coverage for auto-height property
- [x] Add test coverage for deprecations
- [x] Remove remaining deprecations from core specs
- [x] Remove remaining deprecations from package specs

The `build` directory is deleted, and instead the `script` directory takes on an expanded role, getting its own `package.json` and `lib` directories to support an overhauled version of `script/bootstrap`, `script/build`, and `script/test`. Instead of relying on Grunt, we do everything via functions defined in the `script/lib` directory.
### Build script

The _basic_ structure of the new build script is as follows:
- Copy all sources to `atom/out/app`
- Transpile Babel, CoffeeScript, and Less files in place
- Generate pre-cached metadata
- At this point, `out/app` is a valid Electron app that doesn't require transpilation support to run.
- Run [`electron-packager`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) on `out/app` to package it into a distributable application on the current platform.
- Build installer on Windows, code sign on macOS
- Zip stuff up

This is all designed to run only on third-party build providers (CircleCI for macOS, Travis for Linux, and AppVeyor on Windows). We've put zero effort into making these scripts run on internal Janky boxes.
### Release publishing plan

We deliberately omit the artifact uploading step, because our plan is to orchestrate release publishing outside of the build. We'll rely on the build services to store artifacts associated with all builds, and when we're ready to release we'll have a script download these artifacts from Circle, Travis, and AppVeyor and upload them to the releases API and S3. This will help to ensure that all artifacts stay in sync based on a specific commit SHA.

The main reason we did this now is because this test was failing on CircleCI and blocking our build modernization effort and we didn't want to fight with the existing ChromeDriver test.

In the future, I'd like to have a single method on `AtomApplication` called `launch` that takes CLI arguments directly from our main script. We can integration test that method or mock out a method like `openWindow` that takes options to separate unit testing of CLI parsing from window open logic. The point is, the main process code is just JavaScript and we can test it just like we test anything else.

The primary problem is that as of Electron v1.1.0, Node.js was upgraded to v6 and that causes some issues. ~~I believe (and hope) that the only major issue is the usage of older version of graceful-fs in a few of our dependencies. Once those have been resolved, I think we'll be able to sort out the remaining issues in Atom core without too many problems.~~ OK, there are more problems than first anticipated ‚Äî I'll keep updating the task list below as I identify (and fix) problems.

There is another concern though, since Electron v1 removed some [deprecated module `require` bits](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/5373).

I propose that in this PR, we perform the upgrade process in stages, one minor version bump at a time, to minimize the number of issues and hopefully keep it reasonable.

This pull-request tries to supplant Travis and replace it with CircleCI. After trying it out for a while, the build process seems more reliable and faster as well. Moreover, if CircleCI enables parallelism for macOS containers in the future, we could be able to speed up our test suite very easily.

Right now the build fails because of some flaky tests that are not related to CircleCI at all (i.e. Janky and Travis fail too for the same specs), but overall I think we might be able to üö¢ this and let it run alongside Travis for a while so that we can assess how well it performs. If after the test-drive everything looks good, we can :fire: Travis and use CircleCI only.

This is the plan we're on right now:

- [x] Config
  
  Instead of each `TextEditor` internally observing the config and updating its behavior accordingly, the `TextEditorRegistry` (an atom-specific class) will observe the config and update text editors from outside, using new public APIs like `setUndoGroupingInterval`.
  
  In order to handle settings like `nonWordCharacters` which can vary according to the cursor's position, the `TextEditor` will have an optional 'scoped settings delegate', which will allow the editor to query for settings at particular scopes. Example:
  
  ``` js
  editor.setScopedSettingsDelegate({
    getCommentStartString (scopes) {
      if (languageLooksLikeC(scopes)) {
        return ""//""
      } else {
        return ""#""
      }
    },
  
    getNonWordCharacters (scopes) {
      // logic ...
    }
  })
  ```
- [x] GrammarRegistry

This also removes a duplicate call to `DisplayLayer::reset` that was happening in the `TextEditor` constructor. For a big file like `text-editor-component-spec.js`, this makes the editor visible about  120 ms sooner üéâ .

Which points at a problem with requiring a module's internal submodule in `compile-cache-spec.coffee`. Instead of relying on a `season` internal module, with this pull-request we simply verify that the CSON module gets called appropriately and avoid testing its caching/parsing behavior again in Atom (i.e. it's already tested in https://github.com/atom/season/blob/master/spec/cson-spec.coffee#L207).

I am not clear on why Janky cannot find that internal module (maybe npm got updated there and the module is now flattened?), but it felt reasonable to avoid this anti-pattern in the spec so that we can make it more bulletproof independently of which npm version our CI is running.

This bumps apm to 1.11.1, which includes atom/apm#562 and atom/apm#563. Since npm 3 flattens packages by default, the build had to change relatively significantly, and I'm sure there are more edge cases to track down. This also bumps Atom's own npm to 3.9.5.

Of particular note, I removed the `apm clean` command that runs as part of the build. It didn't seem to be working in the first place, and seems to have trouble with npm 3's package flattening; maybe we can delegate to `npm prune` here. Since published builds get built from scratch, I think this is probably not a huge deal.

@atom/core, @atom/feedback, @damieng, I would love for you to pull down this branch and try to build Atom and make sure it runs correctly and that package-related operations work. It's _extremely likely_ you will have to run `script/clean` first; sorry, things are just too different.

## Motivation

Currently we load Bootstrap and then try to override it in core. Merging them allows more control and adjustments can be made directly. Also, moving out of core and into a separate package feels less intimidating and can easier be rolled back in `package.json`.
## Concerns

Some styles got removed, so there is a chance that something might look unstyled or off. Packages bundled with Atom should be fine, but it's hard to predict if community packages rely on any of the removed styles. Maybe in the Beta phase we can catch some regressions.

Affected packages:
- [x] `autocomplete-plus` fixed by [reverting](https://github.com/atom/atom-ui/pull/4) some refactoring.
- [x] [godoc](https://github.com/zmb3/godoc/pull/17) uses `.close`. Fixed by [adding](https://github.com/atom/atom-ui/pull/5) `.close` too.

2) Fixes an issue with resizing atom panes when one or more panes had many open tabs.

After [upgrading to Electron v0.37.8](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11474), we have noticed a couple of regressions when resizing some of Atom's UI elements. In particular, it seems like some of the flexbox rules for laying content out have changed since v0.36.12, and this causes elements like `atom-pane` or find-and-replace input boxes, to not shrink correctly when they are resized.

This pull-request fixes 1) by removing the explicit width on `atom-text-editor`'s `.lines` element (setting it should be unnecessary after #6733), which sometimes caused `atom-text-editor`'s width to determine the width of its parent, and 2) by allowing `atom-pane`s to be shrunk indefinitely, as it was before the Electron bump.

Fixes #11708.

Recently, we have been observing several issues related to losing data when Atom hard-crashes. We think that this problem manifests whenever the following happens:
1. User/Package triggers a file save.
2. `fs.writeFileSync(path)` gets called.
   1. `fd = fs.openSync(path, ""w"")` gets called. This causes the file to be truncated.
   2. Before `fs.writeSync(fd, contents)` has the chance to run, a hard crash occurs.

The scenario described above leaves the file in a ""truncated state"", thus erasing all of its contents. In the past we have experimented with backup files to solve this issue, but that creates other problems such as paths that are too long on Windows, and unnecessary events triggered on fs watchers that are monitoring the saved file's directory. It turns out that atomic saves are not a good trade-off either, as described on https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3158#issuecomment-124225148.

With this pull-request we want to provide a file recovery service running on the main process that keeps track of pending changes, and restores files to their original state when a renderer process crashes while a save is in flight. If the recovery is unsuccessful for any reason (e.g. problems with permissions, unmounted network drives, etc.), we log a message like the following in the system console and in a message box too, so that users can perform the recovery themselves:

```
There was a crash while saving ""/private/etc/profile"", so this file might be blank or corrupted.
Atom couldn't recover it automatically, but a recovery file has been saved at: ""/Users/as-cii/.atom/recovery/profile-950635"".
```

By default we will use `~/.atom/recovery` as our recovery directory, where we temporarily store a backup of the saved file and delete it upon successful save/recovery. The nice thing about using the file system as our recovery storage (as opposed to IndexedDb), is that users can inspect it pretty easily and copy/paste content via Terminal.app or Finder.app (or their equivalent on other platforms). 

As a convention, backup files stored under the recovery directory, will have the following format:

```
{originalFilename}-{randomHexNumber}.{originalExtension}
```

Where:
- `originalFilename` is the name of the file without its extension. This string will be truncated if it's longer than `34` characters.
- `randomHexNumber` is a randomly generated hexadecimal number. This string will be 6 characters long by default.
- `originalExtension` is the extension of the file.

This should be long enough to make filenames readable (and more inspectable), but short enough to avoid path length issues on platforms like Windows.

Rendering line numbers corresponding to lines that need to be measured isn't useful, and it puts unneeded pressure to the DOM. In the process of changing `updateLineNumbersState`, we have also refactored it to stop relying on row ranges being contiguous. This allows that code path to be:
1. Less error-prone, because we were trying to access rows that weren't actually rendered, and thus throwing an exception when measuring non-contiguous screen rows.

The issue was that we were _always_ scheduling `saveState` on an idle callback: `window.onbeforeunload`, however, doesn't wait for that event before closing the window, and thus that state was never saved in those situations.

The solution is to use idle callbacks only during the critical code path (i.e. on mousedown and keydown), but save it synchronously otherwise. Saving something to IndexedDB is actually asynchronous too, but it seems like Chrome/Electron fulfills `put` requests that get executed right during `onbeforeunload`.

The need for such PR arose from another currently open one, #8780 , which combines together a refactoring and a feature improvement related to Windows right-click menu. If this current PR gets merged, then #8780 would be basically superseded, hence closed, and the actual feature improvement could be discussed and brought forward separately.

As things are now, the refactoring part in #8780 needs manual updates and conflict resolution everytime the codebase moves further in the squirrel-update area. By accepting this current PR, that would be set aside once for all.

The first stage performs a binary search on the text nodes of a row to find the node containing the pixelPosition. The second stage performs a binary search within the text node to find the character that contains the pixelPosition. This improves responsiveness when clicking near the end of a very long line of text.

~~This adds a dependency on [`binary-search-with-index`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binary-search-with-index), which is my fork of [`binary-search`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/binary-search). This fork passes the index to the comparator which is needed in the `characterComparator`, and also relicenses the package to MIT. The original package was CC0-1.0 and waived all copyrights, so this should be okay.~~

**Update**: The original package accepted my PR, so the only thing preventing us from using it is that its `CC0-1.0` license doesn't pass the [`legal-eagle`](https://github.com/atom/legal-eagle) check.

This is useful as more recent contexts often have to be resolved first.

For example, when `core:move-down` is called in a `find-and-replace` editor, it will go through its history.
But when an autocompletion listener is added later, it should move through the possible autocompletions.

I am curious how this use case is handled in for plain DOM listeners, as they will always be called [in the order of their registration](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#event-flow). It seems possible that listeners can be backed up, and restored after the context is resolved. I'm not very experienced in front-end development though, do you guys have insight?

1. :bug: Use `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=true`. This allows us to capture the output of calls to `console.warn` and `console.log`, which are useful to log out Grim deprecations.
2. :fire: Remove calls to `logDeprecations`. This method used to format the output captured in `stderr` to strip out ""[Console]"" noise from deprecations. This code path was not running anymore because we started using `stdio: 'inherit'` in #10838 for core specs, which prevents stderr output to be captured.

---

This PR implements the `MessageRegistry`, which is similar to the `CommandRegistry` in that it maps string types of some kind to callback functions, but it differs in that messages originate from outside the application via `atom://` URIs handled via [the `open-url` event](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.4/api/app/#event-open-url-os-x).

This partially implements https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5262, provides a mechanism for hitting things like https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/614 from outside the application (e.g. ""View in Atom"" links on package pages on the Atom site), and would enable package authors to implement things like https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2037 for external debuggers, etc.

There is still some additional work to do around registering Atom as a system-level handler for `atom://` URIs on non-Mac systems, but that probably will be installer-based work.

/cc @atom/core @atom/feedback for review. Some open questions I have are:
- I restricted messages to URIs starting with `atom://atom` as we already [have a mechanism that utilizes URIs with hosts that match package names](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/822e0c95108aadb91631570e386d8cf96d7cfdd0/src/browser/atom-application.coffee#L550-L557) to perform some work. (What is this used for? I'm not familiar with it.) I'd love to get rid of this, as it means we can't use any host that might match a package name. If anyone has bright ideas for URI schemes, that'd be awesome. (I thought maybe something like `atom://.message/...`?)
- Right now, the callback function is called with the string message (just the `namespace:name` portion) and the params, but maybe it makes more sense to pass the entire URI, or the parsed URI object.

11369,5,7,1,Externals,hellendag,2016-04-05T15:34:55Z,77,20,2,0,"Atom currently sets the `value` of the input on every `textInput` event, in an effort to appropriately handle changes made via the OSX diacritic menu (for accents, umlauts, etc).

The drawback of this is approach is that updating the value of the input will trigger layout and a subsequent layer tree update.

To resolve this, here is my proposal:
- Track a flag for `keypress` events. When the diacritic menu is used, there are two `textInput` events, with no `keypress` in between. Therefore, when no `keypress` has occurred just prior to a `textInput`, the editor model can select the previous character to be replaced by the new accented character.
- Track a flag for `compositionstart` events. When a user is in IME mode, the diacritic menu cannot be used, so the editor can skip the backward selection.

Test Plan:

Tested in a plaintext file.
- Type Latin characters, verify proper character insertion.
- Press and hold <kbd>a</kbd>. Diacritic menu appears. Select an option using the keyboard or mouse. Verify that the `a` is replaced by an accented `a`, with no extra characters.
- Type test strings in Katakana, 2-Set Korean, Telex (Vietnamese), Simplified Pinyin. Verify that characters are inserted correctly while composing, and after committing strings.

It turns out that the issue with pinch-to-zoom occurs only under certain circumstances; on my MacBook, it happens only whenever I do the following:
1. Start Atom with my MacBook closed and my external monitor on;
2. Open my Macbook, so that both displays are on;
3. Try to pinch the tree-view;
4. :boom: 

_(The above never happens if my MacBook is open when Atom is launched)_

As soon as a new display gets added or removed, in facts, the zoom level limit of the web frame is reset to the default and hence the page becomes zoomable again. This doesn't happen when changing the display's metrics (e.g. screen resolution), so I assume it must be something related to adding/removing displays. I have verified this arises also when enabling/disabling mirroring, which is considered by OS X as adding/removing one display.

Electron provides two events which allow us to detect when a display gets added or removed, so that we can reset the zoom level limits to `(1, 1)` every time this happens. I suspect this is what is happening in #8850, and this PR should fix it once for all.

On OS X, we noticed that some emojis were not being displayed correctly. This is a problem with the rendering mechanism that Chromium uses and is present in Chrome 50 as well:

However, it seems like it has been fixed on Chrome 51 Canary, where the test above works perfectly:

Even with Chrome 50, however, I noticed that GitHub.com was rendering emojis correctly without using PNGs:

It seems, in fact, that adding the ""Apple Color Emoji"" font to the list of font families allows Chrome to pick up the right glyph to render instead of the ugly box:

As expected, removing it, causes the box to appear (again, this works fine in Chrome Canary 51):

The remaining problem comes down to nodegit's threading model. Nodegit uses a lock to protect against cross-thread memory corruption, race conditions, etc. It also uses libuv's thread pool to do git operations off the main thread.

The problem is that if a lot of git work gets queued up (as happens any time the window comes to the foreground), we can end up with git operations on all of libuv's threads, waiting to acquire the lock. That sucks, because node uses that same thread pool to do all its async work. So we end up blocking node from doing most anything until our git operations are done.

This is most noticeable on slow file systems (e.g., network drives). We‚Äôd essentially end up blocking node from doing anything while we waited on IO.

Instead of using nodegit‚Äôs locking, we‚Äôll use our own serialization mechanism.

This should also afford us more concurrency in the future if/when we need it.

- In the flaky tests, we're leaking paths that are being watched by buffers that I _know_ are being created via `Workspace::open`.
- That means these buffers should be destroyed in `atom.clear()` in the `afterEach` block that's defined in our spec helper to follow every test. As part of destruction, we destroy our watch subscriptions.
- Yet even after destroying all editors and buffers, we still seem to be leaking watches. This leads me to believe there is some subtle error in pathwatcher itself.

Ultimately, it's not clear that the value of this global assertion really warrants this level of hassle. I'm making a pragmatic call to convert this to a warning. If we're seeing it a lot as we develop code that watches paths, then we're probably leaking. If we see it once in a blue moon on CI it's probably just this issue. I don't think it's worth it to invest more time understanding it right now.

`git status` involves lots of IO (mostly `stat`s). On most file systems, this isn‚Äôt a big deal. But on slow file systems (e.g., networked drives), this can be quite costly.

In order to trivially maintain `GitRepository`s API after adding `GitRepositoryAsync`, we simply left it as-is, but that meant we were doing `git status` twice.

The biggest problem was that calling `repo.workdir()` on the main thread involved acquiring a lock, which could already be held by a background thread doing disk IO. And on network filesystems, that IO was really expensive, which meant the lock would be held for a looooooong time. See also https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/pull/968 which removes the need for `repo.workdir()` and friends to acquire the lock.

There are a couple other cases that we found where a lock could be acquired on the main thread:
- [x] `repo.path()`
- [x] `Git.Ignore.pathIsIgnored` (https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/pull/970)

Even with these changes, performance will still be worse than 1.5.4 because both `GitRepository` and `GitRepositoryAsync` are refreshing their status from git which requires a lot of IO‚Äîwhere in 1.5.4 we only had `GitRepository`.

Ideally `GitRepository` would only do work if some package is using it. Currently that‚Äôll always be the case as `tree-view` hasn‚Äôt been updated to use `GitRepositoryAsync` yet (see https://github.com/atom/tree-view/pull/624).

Closes #10966.

After #10605 we have noticed some slowdowns during multi-cursor edits which we have tried to address in #10925 by switching from structured cloning to `JSON.stringify` when we had to serialize state. Even though that was faster, it led to several issues like stringifying cyclic structures and taking more and more time as the `History` grew over time.

With this PR we still continuously save the `AtomEnvironment`'s state, but we try to address the above concerns by: 
1. Incrementally converting history changes to a binary format. (https://github.com/atom/atom-patch/pull/7)
2. Serialize marker snapshots only before quitting. Although this won't maintain selection after hard crashes, the user history will always be preserved.

The result is the following:

(**Total:** `~ 40ms`, benchmarks performed by simultaneously writing 5 characters on 1500 lines)

Those `~ 34ms` will only be payed the first time new history entries need to be serialized, because we will reuse a cached binary representation of them whenever they need to be serialized again.

As a byproduct, and thanks to history's internals restructuring, undos/redos with many overlapping changes will get faster, as we compose and merge them without repeating some of the work for the intersecting regions.

It would be awesome to have some feedback on this, especially to understand how this feels to you performance-wise after a test-drive.

10925,2,6,0,Internals,as-cii,2016-02-23T09:10:02Z,23,10,2,0,"Last week we discovered with @kuychaco that serializing state is taxing on Atom's responsiveness, because serialization happens on the main thread. As per https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=536620, we discovered that structured clone isn't very performant and therefore we started researching a different approach that could perform better.

Below you can take a look at a profile of `saveState` and `IndexedDb.put()`:

![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/13218622/135896a4-d96b-11e5-84b1-57eef4b94b74.png)

**Total:** `~ 116ms` for inserting 11 characters on 200 cursors.

We decided to attack the problem in two ways:
1. Use `JSON.stringify` instead of structured clone to store state in IndexedDb.
2. Defer work until a `requestIdleCallback` is dispatched. This allows to avoid blocking the main thread if some important operation is being performed.

For the same scenario, this is how this PR performs:

![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/13218818/3aeeae00-d96c-11e5-8112-9812b6fd0195.png)

**Total:** `~ 40ms`, `~ 3x` faster. :racehorse:
#### Serializing History

Another problem we noticed is that the more edits get performed on a certain buffer the slower serializing its history becomes. This makes sense, especially in the context of large multi-cursor operations, where a single checkpoint in history could contain lots of changes. 

![history](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/13219700/fa7c2220-d971-11e5-91c9-ca34289e5e19.png)

**Total:** `~ 130ms`, for inserting 5 characters on 1500 cursors.

This is an issue we still have to solve, but here's a list of potential solutions:
1. Remove history serialization altogether. I didn't expect history to be remembered across sessions and I believe this is not a ""loss of work"" scenario, although it's admittedly a nice feature. Sublime Text doesn't preserve history after closing the window, but you might argue that our users are already familiar with this behavior.
2. Add an option to preserve history. The default would be false, and users can decide to opt-in if they want to keep the original behavior.
3. Incrementally serialize history's state. This might be a nice improvement for long-running editor sessions, because we just have to serialize new changes as they come in, avoiding the repeated work of serializing the same state over and over and spreading the cost over a large timespan. This won't help the multi-cursor scenario, though, where a huge amount of changes could be collected over a short amount of time, and hence slow down the UI.
4. Serialize state across multiple `requestIdleCallback`s. This is a nice idea in theory because it allows to split the cost of serialization in `50ms` chunks, thus not blocking the main thread at all. In practice, however, it might be difficult to both keep track of changes and serialize stuff in parallel: for example, what happens if, while serializing state, an edit occurred?
5. After :ship:ping web workers, move this work off the main thread. I think @nathansobo brought up this idea in the past, but basically we could have a separate `TextBuffer` instance working on another thread; as changes come in, we `postMessage` to the worker thread and we let it deal with all the serialization stuff. This somewhat depends on structured clone being fast, though, because otherwise sending message to the worker thread would let the main thread pay roughly the same cost of serialization.

I believe 2) could actually be fine because it would allows us to keep this code path fast without sacrificing simpleness.
#### Conclusion

I think it might okay to :ship: and experiment with this even if we do not solve the problem illustrated above. If serialization is still a bottleneck after test-driving this, we definitely need to back the feature out and address the problem from another, more performant perspective.

Which means, user presses `ctrl-y`, then lifts `ctrl` to fire the `core:do-stuff` command. If any other keybinding is used instead of a `ctrl` keyup after the `ctrl-y`, the command will not be dispatched.

This has a knock-on effect for features such as the Tree View, which shows individually opened files as though they are directories (as opposed to the correct functionality, whereby Tree View shows the file's parent directory and highlights the opened file).

This was because the module was checking for the presence of a protocol in the path passed to it in order to determine whether it was a local file path or a URL (such as atom://config/something). Unfortunately, on Windows the drive letter (e.g. `c:`) was identified as a protocol.

The fix put in place replaces the check for a protocol with one that checks for a hostname. In valid URLs this should come back as a non-empty string, but on Windows it'll come back empty meaning the module correctly identifies the string as a file path.

There are other `TextEditors` that are of interest though.
For example, the editor in `find-and-replace` might want autocomplete functionality (atom/autocomplete-plus#383).

With this change, any editor created through `workspace.buildTextEditor` can be observed, which seemed the cleanest way to observe `TextEditors` across a varied use in the model.

Although this code path will partially, and positively, be affected by the in-progress `DisplayLayer` redesign, I believe that reducing the number of cursors we need to iterate is still valuable in terms of performance and reduces the number of `getEnd()` queries we need to perform against `MarkerIndex`.

After merging the above PR in master, I'd like to avoid waiting for v1.7.0 to be released before I can merge PRs that update packages to use the new deserializer and view-provider APIs. I can change the packages in a backwards-compatible way, but I need to temporarily remove the logic that I added in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9687 for handling the slightly-different API that I had introduced previously.

This should be pretty risk-free, since it just removes calls to some methods that I recently added. Once it goes :green_heart:, my intent is to merge it directly into stable and publish a new patch release, just to unblock continuing efforts to use the improved APIs.

10764,2,4,0,Internals,maxbrunsfeld,2016-02-11T20:38:40Z,59,58,11,0,"This makes some further changes to the new `package.json`-based deserializer and view-provider APIs introduced in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/9687. After updating some packages (see https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9974) to use these new fields, I realized that it was somewhat awkward to specify deserializers and view providers in separate files from the packages's main module. I think it is better if these fields work similarly to `consumedServices` and `providedServices`, by specifying names of methods on the package's main module.
#### Example

`package.json`

``` json
{
  ""name"": ""my-package"",
  ""main"": ""index"",
  ""deserializers"": {
    ""MyObject"": ""deserializeMyObject""
  },
  ""viewProviders"": [
    ""buildMyObjectView""
  ]
}
```

`index.js`

``` js
const MyObject = require('./my-object')

module.exports = {
  activate () {
    // ...
  },

  deserializeMyObject (state) {
    return new MyObject(state)
  },

  buildMyObjectView (model) {
    if (model instanceof MyObject) {
      return new MyObjectView
    }
  }
}
```
#### Advantages
- This approach is more consistent with `consumedServices` and `providedServices`, which seem to be working well for a variety of use cases.
- Many packages currently maintain singleton instances of some view or model object, and keep a reference to it in their main module. This makes it easier for view providers and deserializers to create or update that singleton instance. The alternative would be for the instance to be stored as a global variable in the deserializer file, or in some third file that is required by both the main module and the deserializer.
- Similarly, this allows the deserializer to interact with any of the package's consumed or provided services with less boilerplate.
- Overall, I like the idea of the package's main module being the only file that needs global state, and all other files in the package exporting classes or functions.
#### Drawbacks
- The main module will be required earlier now, for packages that either 1) have view providers, or 2) have deserializers that are needed immediately. But _some_ code file would have to be required under these conditions regardless, so I think as long as the main module defers its requires effectively, it shouldn't make any difference in terms of load time.

So this fix is a little fussy.
1. Ideally we‚Äôd simply update the window load settings with the window dimensions before we reload, so that the reloaded window has the same dimensions.
2. **But** any changes we make to the window load settings in our `beforeunload` handler aren‚Äôt reflected in the reload. (I suspect Chromium‚Äôs grabbing the location for reload before calling the handler?)
3. So the next best thing: we detect a reload before `beforeunload` is called and update the window load settings there. This worked for _most_ reloads but I wasn‚Äôt able to find a hook for reloads triggered by cmd-r with the dev tools focused. That inconsistency would have been super annoying, to me at least.
4. So instead we track whether this is the first time the window‚Äôs been loaded. If it is, we use the default dimensions. If it isn‚Äôt, we use the dimensions we‚Äôre already saving in state.

First thing I did was give the `Pane` class an `itemStack` property to keep track of the order the items were used. The main function I added is `activateNextRecentlyUsedItem` which walks down the `itemStack` each time the user hits tab after ctrl is held down.

I set up the keymap for ctrl-tab but I still don't have the keymaps figured out for when ctrl is held down and tab is pressed over and over before lifting up on ctrl.  Something else I need to figure out is how to call a specific function to move an item to the top of the stack once ctrl is lifted.  

So, based on the assumption that I can make a keymap for holding down ctrl and pressing tab over and over (suggestions are welcome), I set up my code so that `activateNextRecentlyUsedItem` would be called each time the user hits tab when holding down ctrl.  Each call to this function would walk down the `itemStack`.  When the user lifted the ctrl key, somehow we would need to call `moveItemToTopOfStack` which would move the item the user stopped on to the top of the stack.

I modified the serialization, too, so the `itemStack` would persist.  The 4 scenarios I was focusing on are:
- nothing is wrong
- no `itemStack` serialized
- some items not serialized
- for some reason there is a different number of items in the `itemStack` than in the `items` array

I wrote tests for the MRU functionality and for the different serialization scenarios.

So yeah, this won't work correctly until I can figure out the key maps for holding ctrl down and hitting tab more than once and until I can figure out how to call `moveItemToTopOfStack` when ctrl is lifted.

The general idea is that the `AutoUpdateManager` which runs on the main thread will pass on events from the auto updater in Electron (or whatever needs to manage update checking in the future) corresponding with the update lifecycle - checking, available, not available, downloading, downloaded - to the renderer over IPC, the app delegate will proxy them, and then the Update wrapper (available at `atom.update`) will bind to the delegate and proxy them for clients (such as the about package)

---

Edit from @benogle:

Previously there was just an `update-available` and a `update-not-available` event. Respectively, these meant ""there is an update, it's been downloaded and it's ready to install"", and ""atom is up to date"". The only one exposed was `update-available` via `atom.onUpdateAvailable`. We needed more granularity for atom/about#12, so now there are more events.

This change adds a renderer process `AutoUpdateManager` which is hanging off of `atom.autoUpdater`. The events it supports are:

``` js
onDidBeginCheckingForUpdate(callback)
onDidBeginDownloadingUpdate(callback)
onDidCompleteDownloadingUpdate(callback)
onUpdateNotAvailable(callback)
```

This is probably an 80% point to something cleanish regarding update code. The underlying AutoUpdateManager still emits `update-available` events when the entire update has been downloaded. I was worried about breaking things, so that work can be done as a separate effort. These event names should be changed and `atom.onUpdateAvailable` deprecated in favor of events on `atom.autoUpdater`.

This PR moves clipping of measured positions up to the editor and out of `LinesYardstick`. This allows us to check for the presence of a row in the editor after clipping is applied and saves complexity since `LinesYardstick` is only used internally and we can always control whether we clip the position we pass in.

Instead of just checking whether a row is visible in the model, we also check whether a DOM node with the line's assigned id is present. If It isn't, we force a synchronous render.

This PR provides a different strategy for wrapping lines whenever CJK characters are involved. With this PR we try to detect a CJK character before or exactly at the desired wrap boundary: if we do, we perform the wrap; otherwise, we use the old line-breaking algorithm.

Although not compliant with the Unicode spec, this allows users to mix CJK characters with Latin ones without the need to introduce a complex line breaking logic.

- Added a config `core.automaticallyUpdate`. This config is enabled by default, but if user disable it, the new Atom window won't check update/schedule update on startup.
- I didn't observer the config changes after initialization, which means if user change the automaticallyUpdate config, it won't change the autoupdate behavior until user quit and start Atom again, but we could observer this changes if we think it's necessary.
- Remove the build option `--no-auto-update` and revert all related code introduced in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/8721

- run the `scrip/build` to build a new Atom.app.
- noticed the `enableAutoupdate` is selected by default, and the checkUpdate button showed up in Atom menu.
- disable `enableAutoupdate` option, open a new Atom window, the checkUpdate button disappeared from Atom menu.
- Note that since the build of Atom don't have certs, so I can't tell if the download is happening or not.

Fixes #942.

Our serialization code already supported saving state for untitled `TextBuffer` instances, but the problem was that we used the file's path to identify and search for buffers in `TokenizedBuffer` and `atom.project`. This PR changes it so that, in addition to paths, we can make use of a uniquely generated id for each `TextBuffer`.

If the `TokenizedBuffer`'s state has a buffer path, we deserialize it exactly as before. Otherwise, we try to search by buffer id among all the project's buffers. It might be tempting to use IDs even when we have a path, but it still seems quite reasonable to just use them as a fallback for two potential problems:
1. Possible weird mismatches or false duplicates (e.g. two buffers have the same path, but different IDs)
2. Even if a buffer is not present in `atom.project`, we still want re-open a buffer at that location when deserializing a `TokenizedBuffer` (I am not sure we have any guarantee that this never happens).

Feedback welcome! :balloon:

We think it will be easier to follow if the `LinesYardstick` never forces a DOM update, but instead requires all lines being measured to be on the DOM as part of its contract.

That means we break `TextEditorComponent.updateSync` into two explicit pre-measurement and post-measurement phases directly in the component so it's more explicit to see, then add visibility checks and synchronous updates on any of the exposed measurement methods on the component.

This might have conflicts with block decorations, but it's going to make it easier for us to maneuver as we render via the `DisplayLayer`'s `TokenIterator` instead of from `TokenizedLines`.

The above GIF lasts `~ 50s` and showcases the integration of the block decorations API with the existing primitives within Atom (so, bear with it if it takes a bit to load :sweat_smile:). By default, we attach a decoration to a screen row: when the buffer changes or the underlying marker moves, we make sure to move the block decoration as well so that we can correctly calculate the other visual elements positions with respect to such decoration.

A block decoration can be created through the standard API to decorate markers:

``` js
editor.decorateMarker(
  editor.markScreenPosition([screenRow, 0]),
  {type: ""block"", item: item}
)
```

Decorations will be (re)measured if:
1. They are visible.
2. They are invisible but they were just added.
3. The editor width changes.
4. `TextEditorElement::invalidateBlockDecorationDimensions(blockDecoration)` is called.
5. They intersect with the buffer splicing region.

There could be some edge cases I haven't taken into account, but here's what I think it's missing:
- [x] Implement a non-linear (logarithmic) algorithm to handle screen-to-pixel positions conversion.
- [x] `offsetHeight` doesn't take margins into account.
- [x] Remove `addBlockDecorationForScreenRow`.
- [x] What happens when resizing the editor? Some block decorations above could need to be resized, thus changing all the items' position after them.
- [x] Correctly handle buffer vs. screen rows by invalidating the splicing region.
- [x] Handle custom gutters as well.
- [x] Inspect the `~ 3-4ms` slowdown when adding/removing many block decorations outside the shadow root.
  - This doesn't seem to be related to block decorations having a unique `id` or being teleported inside the shadow DOM because of `<content>`. Instead, it appears that some styles that cross the shadow boundary make style recalculation a bit slower when many block decorations get swapped in and out from screen. 
- [x] Add missing documentation (mark everything as experimental)
- [x] Allow to position block decorations before or after the marked position
- [x] Update documentation
- [ ] Test-drive! :car:
- [x] **Question:** should we implement a version that works without the shadow DOM? Maybe we can defer this to another PR, when the API stabilizes.

Before this PR, we were using `addEventListener` to listen for commands on elements with the `.native-key-bindings` class. The only way a command (i.e. not a standard event) can be triggered on an HTML element, however, is through `atom-keymap`, but that doesn't happen whenever a native keymap is fully matched.

In the old jQuery days, whenever adding an event listener on the document, we also called `atom.commands.add`, thus allowing to listen on the document and still being notified for events dispatched manually from `CommandRegistry`. After dropping it, though, we didn't update the `handleNativeKeybindings` code path to use `CommandRegistry`, thus not hitting that code path anymore when e.g. copy-pasting because those kinds of event are _synthesized_ (and not triggered on the DOM) whenever a command from `ApplicationMenu` or `ContextMenu` is dispatched.

It would be awesome if anyone could verify that the above rationale is sound, 'cause I'm relatively new to this area of the codebase. :smile_cat:

The above issue can be consistently reproduced by switching to Dvorak and trying to open the DevTools through `Cmd-Alt-I` (which, if you have a Qwerty keyboard, is `Cmd-Alt-G`). This doesn't happen on most Qwerty keyboards and, quite oddly, I tracked down the problem to be related to DevTools being opened or closed. Indeed, if we try to replace `ApplicationDelegate::toggleWindowDevTools` with a simple log statement this problem doesn't seem to be reproducible. The reason why only certain keyboard layouts trigger this particular behavior is obscure to me at the moment, but somehow I believe this has to do with the DevTools appearing and disappearing, thereby confusing Chromium's input events. (@zcbenz: maybe you have some ideas on what's triggering this behavior?)

I think this wasn't caused by a recent Electron upgrade, but rather to the way we have changed Atom DevTools interaction: in the past, this was asynchronous but it got changed to be sync during the `AtomEnvironment` refactoring. I switched back to using an asynchronous approach, so that our keybinding/commands event handlers have the chance to fully execute without waiting for DevTools to be opened/closed.

I _think_ we were using a sync version because [these lines of code](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/atom-environment.coffee#L672-L674) need to be executed in succession, so that the javascript code can be run when DevTools are already open. It turns out that, before these changes, the console wasn't getting shown if DevTools were closed because we still have to wait until the `devtools-opened` event gets triggered. This PR fixes also this problem by implementing a Promise-based API on top of Electron DevTools API.

9687,15,2,0,Internals,maxbrunsfeld,2015-11-30T23:53:37Z,332,47,23,12,"#### The Problem

In order to interoperate with the deserialization of the Atom workspace, there are some APIs that packages have to call as soon as they are loaded (as opposed to inside of their `activate` method):
- `atom.views.addViewProvider`
- `atom.deserializers.add`

This forces Atom to load all packages' main modules at an early point in startup, even though many packages can be _activated_ lazily. This allows packages to affect the app even if they are disabled, and may reduce our ability to optimize startup time.
#### The Proposed API Change

This PR will add 3 new optional fields to packages' `package.json` files:
- `configSchema` - an object specifying the package's config schema
- `deserializers` - an object whose keys are deserializer names, and whose values are paths to files that export deserialization functions
- `viewProviders` - an array whose values are paths to files that export view-providing functions. These will need to work a little bit differently than normal view providers, because they can't be specified in relation to a particular model constructor. Maybe they will just be functions that return `null` if they do not apply to the given model.

It will also add a deprecation warning when packages accesses the `atom` global at load time.
#### Changes to Package Loading

When packages use the new `package.json` fields, we can defer loading any of their code until it is used, because we can know that there is no reason for them to run code at load time.
- The main module will be loaded when the package is activated.
- View providers will be loaded when either the package is activated.
- Deserializers will be loaded when `deserialize` is called with one of the specified deserializer names.

Once the deprecation period is over, we can use this approach for all packages.
#### Todo
- [x] Respect the 3 new fields in package.json.
- Use new fields to optimize package loading
  - [x] If a package has `configSchema`, `viewProviders`, or `deserializers`, don't load its main module until it is activated.
  - [x] Don't load a package's view providers until either it is activated or one of its deserializers is used.
- [x] Remember which packages use the atom global at require time, and for those that don't, don't require the main module until they are activated.

Currently in Atom, Command-W will close every pane item in the current pane, then the current pane, and so on until every pane is empty, which makes sense since pane items and panes ~ tabs. However, when only the empty root pane is left, which the user experiences as there being no panes left at all, hitting Command-W will not close the window, but will instead have no effect at all. To actually close the window, one needs to either manually hit the red close button in the upper left corner or the window, choose ""Close Window"" in the File menu or use the Cmd-Shift-W shortcut, all of which break the OS X UX contract.

With this PR, Command-W will behave exactly as it does right now, with one exception: when only the root pane is left, Command-W closes the entire window.

Hitting Command-W with only one pane item ~ tab open will NOT close the window, which is inconsistent with tabbed web browsing but makes more sense for a text editor.

After the changes in #8968, `ThemeManager::isInitialLoadComplete` [was always being set to true](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/atom-environment.coffee#L185-L186), whereas in the past we used to set it only after all the theme packages had been activated.

How does this relate to scrollbars? When restoring the previous state we attach the workspace along with the needed `TextEditorElement`s. When `TextEditorComponent` gets instantiated, it uses `isInitialLoadComplete` to decide whether it should listen to `ThemeManager::onDidChangeActiveThemes`, which is what triggers `::refreshScrollbars` after e.g. `one-dark-ui` loads.

Since `::isInitialLoadComplete` was true before the themes had the chance to actually being loaded, we weren't refreshing scrollbars at all, thus not allowing webkit to apply the needed stylesheets (when we refresh the scrollbars we explicitly trigger a reflow to let Chrome handle stylesheets correctly).

This PR changes the existing behavior so that we mark the initial theme load as complete only in test mode (through a configurable option).

This has two advantages:
- this will enable (in a later step) to enable auto-upgrade to follow multiple channels (optionally in parallel in different directories). We can even think giving a way for people to switch between channels as needed (given the user config stay backward compatible). I'm happy to work on those 2 problematics after/if this PR is merged at some point.
- if all dependencies are installed in the distribution, the atom installation is then just a question of extracting an archive, requiring non root permission contrary to the .deb or .rpm packages.

We can then integrate this archive to be downloaded to some tools like Ubuntu Make (https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make/issues/6).

We generate a .tar.gz compressed archive (we could switch to a more performant .tar.xz, but the first format is more widespread and usual). I did add the `mktar` to the `CI task` (I saw the rpm wasn't in there, so I guess, it's only running on an Ubuntu machine) and tested it. I did add the task as well to `upload-assets`, but of course, I couldn't test it ;) The changes there are though minimal, but I can modify what's necessary as needed.

As _version_ contains _upstream version + channel name_, I didn't change anything in the naming of the archive publication, and the folder in archive contains thus an uniquely defined build.

Of course, the resulting archive is linked against the libraries available in the builder version. mktar is run where the .deb is built, which is, I guess, the latest ubuntu LTS. I tried the built archive on 14.04 LTS, 15.04, 15.10 and xenial (dev version), and everything is working as expected. If this doesn't work on other distros (which, looking at the deps, seems unlikely and we already only have one deb for debian/ubuntu and one rpm for fedora/opensuse‚Ä¶), we can build multiple archives. But I propose we starts with this one.

This method is supposed to wrap asynchronous code within a `Config` transaction. It accepts a `callback` which must return a `Promise`: when this resolves or gets rejected (or the `callback` throws an error) we complete the transaction.

I am not super happy with the name I've chosen for this API, as it would have probably been better to follow Node's conventions (i.e. rename `::transact` to `::transactSync` and name the new one `::transact`): unfortunately that method name was already taken and it's part of the public API.

Another thought was to include this feature right inside the existing `::transact` method: although possible, the resulting method would need to conform to two different contracts based on the return type of `callback`, which feels somewhat misleading for clients. In the end having a separate method felt somewhat cleaner.

Feedback super welcome! :bow:

This is a pull request version of https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2734#issuecomment-155230824 in order to work together on solving the currently unfair grammar scoring system. The main problem with the current system is that it gives a higher score to HTML grammar for any file that begins with HTML doctype, but the file might be using PHP or some other (templating) language that utilizes HTML syntax (with a different file type, eg `php`).

@nathansobo suggested adding an option to fall back to using the old system in case the new one breaks something, but I am not sure how to do that exactly. Also another question would be whether this transition period is needed at all, because all it ""breaks"" right now is grammar selection for files, for which there is a known file type, but the first line is matched from some other grammar. A fix for that case would be just adding the file type via user configuration, to override the known type from the other language.

9508,3,5,0,Internals,as-cii,2015-11-11T08:10:56Z,16,8,2,0,"When activating a package, we load its settings asynchronously. Then, as soon as Node is done with IO, it calls us back with the content of those files, at which point we call `ScopedProperties::activate` to transfer those settings into our `Config` instance.

When setting a key in our `Config`, we emit an event that notifies attached listeners that something has just changed: the implications of this are pretty important, as there is a remarkable amount of operations we need to do in order to notify those clients, such as comparing the newly set key with the previous one, etc. Although the current implementation could be somewhat improved in terms of performance, it handles the configuration semantics pretty smartly, which means that, whenever setting something in the configuration, it's better to emit as little events as possible. For this reason, before the changes introduced with this PR, we were [wrapping packages activation with a call to `Config::transact`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/46665c1f8b86664f9431d66cfd9e291bdc0689cf/src/package-manager.coffee#L419-L423).

The problem with this approach, however, is that it doesn't play well with the asynchronous nature of loading the configuration, as the transaction will end as soon as we've finished iterating over the packages to activate (i.e. _before_ `ScopedProperties::activate` has the chance to execute). This means we emit way more events than we really should, paying an extra amount of time during startup:

![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/11060723/54d06bae-87a2-11e5-9749-9103bcd74e67.png)

The breakdown here is the following:
- Parsing CSON: `~ 39.2ms`
- Activating Grammars: `~ 71.0ms`
- Activating Settings: `122.4ms` + `37.9ms`
- **Total: 294.9ms**

For this reason, we have introduced a `Config::beginTransaction` and `Config::endTransaction`, which are aimed to handle the asynchronous scenario in a more performant manner:

![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/11060724/551a89b4-87a2-11e5-9a4d-43c11afed1a6.png)

We can observe a a `~ 125ms` speedup, as this approach allows us to emit just a minimal amount of events, thereby dramatically reducing the overhead of loading setting files.

For the future, I think it's also worth taking a look at how we might improve CSON (which, for bundled packages, is actually JSON) parsing and grammars activation, in order to reduce those remaining `169.7ms` to the minimum.

In the previous implementation we were constantly querying `TextBuffer` for folds whenever the grammar on `TextEditor` changed:

Indeed, when changing the grammar we issue a call to `LanguageMode::unfoldAll` which tries to get a fold for each row in the buffer.

This happens also on startup because grammars are loaded after a `TextEditor` instance gets created. Moreover, user's perceived responsiveness gets worse as more files (or larger files) need to be opened/restored because we change the grammar for every instance of `TextEditor` as soon as the packages' grammars are loaded and a new grammar is recognized.
### Solution

With this PR, instead of issuing a `findMarker` call to `TextBuffer` for each buffer row, we just get all the folds intersecting the whole buffer and destroy them in reverse order. This is how the first graph looks like after the improvements:

![screen shot 2015-11-06 at 13 22 04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/10998210/d2316e20-8493-11e5-9458-9c58ab169d3c.png)

Calling `::unfoldAll` is almost instantaneous now and for a single ~3000 lines file this saves almost `150ms`. :racehorse: :racehorse: :racehorse: 

In the same code path there's still some work we could do to make loading settings faster, as it would seem like we spend a considerable amount of time in just setting keys/values in `Config` (at least during startup). Nevertheless, this should result in a significant responsiveness increase when users boot up Atom with some open files.

It also un-deprecates `TextEditor::getFirstVisibleScreenRow`, making it possible to synchronously read the editor's vertical scroll position.

This was driven out by vim-mode's [`ScrollFullPage` commands](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/e1d1a3edbaa16b6010e688b07c6cb3b9cd5c95a9/lib/motions/general-motions.coffee#L454), which need to synchronously update the editor's scroll position.

I've refactored the presenter so that it doesn't store its own copy of the `scrollRow` and `scrollColumn` state, using the model instead as the source of truth for these concepts. As part of this effort, I refactored the way the presenter's `scrollTop` and `scrollLeft` are initialized; they're now computed based on the `firstVisibleScreen{Row,Column}` as soon as the necessary measurements (line-height and base-character-width) are assigned.

Searching for `e` in `jquery.js` now blocks the UI thread for ~1 second instead of ~3.2 seconds. Inserting newlines in this file with the markers present now takes ~10 ms instead of ~35 ms.

I still need to make the changes to find-and-replace backwards compatible and merge them after merging these changes.
## API Changes
### Marker Layers

A huge problem with our existing implementation is that creating markers emits synchronous events to support existing packages and core APIs. We needed a way to opt out of these event handlers for high-volume use cases, and marker layers were a good way to do this.
- `TextBuffer`
  - `.addMarkerLayer({maintainHistory})` Creates and returns a `MarkerLayer` object. If `maintainHistory` is `true`, markers will be restored on calls to undo/redo.
  - `.getMarkerLayer` Retrieve a marker layer based on its id.
- `MarkerLayer` Some highlights:
  - `.markRange` Creates a marker.
  - `.getMarker` Gets a marker by id.
  - `.findMarkers` Queries the marker layer.
  - `.onDidUpdate` Called asynchronously whenever markers are created, updated, or destroyed. Can be used without being a drag on performance, but you'll have to re-query any state you're interested in between calls.
  - `.onDidCreateMarker` This is needed to support our current synchronous selection APIs, but it shouldn't be used on layers that will contain a large number of markers because it slows down insertion.
  - `.copy` Create and return a new marker layer with all the same markers.
- `TextEditor`
  - `.addMarkerLayer({maintainHistory})` Creates and returns a `TextEditorMarkerLayer`.
  - `.getMarkerLayer` Retrieve an editor-level marker layer based on its id.
- `TextEditorMarkerLayer` This is a wrapper around a buffer-level `MarkerLayer` object and shares the same id.
  - `.markBufferRange` Create a marker.
  - `.markScreenRange` Create a marker.
  - `.findMarkers` Query markers with the same API as `TextEditor.prototype.findMarkers`
### Marker Layer Decorations

Another huge source of slowness in find and replace is that we decorated each marker individually. Now that we have marker layers, we can decorate an entire layer in the same way, avoiding a ton of allocations.
- `TextEditor`
  - `.decorateMarkerLayer(layer, properties)` Accepts a `MarkerLayer` or `TextEditorMarkerLayer` and the same properties that `decorateMarker` takes. It creates a decoration for every marker in the layer based on these parameters. This won't work for custom gutter decorations or overlay decorations, but _will_ work for highlights, line, and line number decorations. Returns a `LayerDecoration`.
- `LayerDecoration`
  - `setPropertiesForMarker(marker, properties)` This can be used to override the properties of a particular marker in the layer. We needed this to support the ""current result"" in find and replace without major changes to the package code. Pass `null` to clear the override.
## New Marker Index

![marker-binary-tree](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/10924350/062ead24-823b-11e5-85ee-ffd1e77df82f.png)

This PR also incorporates a new binary-tree-based [marker-index](https://github.com/atom/marker-index), which replaces the previous b-tree-based index in text-buffer. It offers better and more predictable performance... about 33% faster on my insertion tests (from 1.6 second to 1 second) and an order of magnitude faster at splicing. 1 second is still too long to block the UI thread, so we may still need to background the index population. I would like to experiment with a C++ implementation and see what it buys us, since it's a straightforward implementation that should be fairly easy to port.
## Performance Improvements

Now on to the good part... the improvement. This shows results from 3 implementations. The current version, marker layers with the old index, and marker layers with the new index.

 This is an enhancement to Portable Mode PR #8442 to provide a command line parameter for Atom to automatically set up a Portable Mode directory (a .atom directory as a sibling to the directory containing the Atom executable).

This uses -p and --set-portable

This copies the .atom home from the default location to the portable location, assuming someone who has been using Atom and wants to go portable would want to take with them what they have already installed/configured.  This may or may not be a good assumption.

We've been searching very hard for a way to make startup faster: the biggest low hanging fruit seemed to be `vm.runInThisContext` which, before this improvement, took more than `250ms-300ms`. That function is used inside `Module.prototype._compile` for, surprise, compiling the source code: although v8 compiler is quite fast already, our codebase has grown quite a lot and the more files we added, the worse the situation would get.

The snapshot approach tried in #9265 should have indirectly solved this, but it felt way too complicated to construct an `AtomEnvironment` inside the snapshot context. Instead, we are taking advantage of a v8 compiler feature that allows to speed up source code compilation by producing/consuming a cache blob. By using this mechanism, we have managed to change startup times from (without any tab open):

:tada: :tada: :tada:

There's still some aspect we could improve, such as where these cache blobs get stored: I used files as the storage mechanism, as it allows us to keep the code pretty simple, but they take ~40ms to get read. There are alternatives to this (e.g. asar), but I am not sure it would improve the situation that much: even a 50% improvement, would make this just ~20ms faster at the expense of making code a bit more complex.

Please, note that whenever DevTools are open, v8 seems to make this optimization a bit worse: if you, however, spawn Atom:
- via cmd;
- by running the executable;
- by reloading the window with DevTools closed;

You will notice the speedup. @zcbenz: any ideas why this happens? I guess this covers already 100% of the average use cases and won't matter to the end user, but if possible it seems to be still worth investigating.

After this lands, I will go on hunting other things that are slowing startup down: we feel like IO could be the main cause but we'll get a better picture after this improvement gets :ship:ped.

We would love to speed up the responsiveness of various aspects of Atom (tree-view, etc) by doing more Git operations asynchronously, and it would also be nice to get out of the business of maintaining our own libgit2 wrapper.

Here are a few notes about the reasoning behind some decisions here:
- It follows the existing GitRepository API closely, changing everything sync to Promise-based async.
  - The assumption is that having a close mapping between the sync and aysnc APIs will make it less painful to refactor client packages.
  - I'm not 100% sure we should keep this design, so it's a tradeoff between design quality and incurred labor. Ideally we'll keep this private and experimental all the way until Atom 2.0 so that we can change it as we need to.
- The class is written in ES6, because Coffeescript, while lovely, is the past, and the community seems to have consensus on transpilers like babel.
  - This includes an .eslintrc, because I've found it extremely useful.
  - The spec is still in coffee because I thought it might be easier to just modify it as I go to make sure I had the same coverage on both classes, though at the moment I wish I'd run it through a coffee -> js converter first.
- I haven't done a lot of ES6 or constructed a Promise-based API for anything serious before, so I'm sure to misuse some APIs.
- We'll need to keep the sync GitRepository class around for backwards compat, so I haven't decided quite how to integrate this with the current provider system.
  - Perhaps we add a private method on the sync repo like `GitRepository.async` that returns the Promise for an async repo, so that internal callers can use async without changing anything in the `GitRepositoryProvider`?
- Documentation is sparse because I wasn't sure this was a good path to follow until today. I'll flesh it out more as I go.

- It fixes an issue where the `resourcePath` wasn't being correctly assigned for `devMode`, which required `--dev` to always be passed to avoid throwing an exception when loading bundled keymaps.
- It overrides `console.log` and friends in headless tests to log to the terminal, working around a change in Electron 33 that requires `--enable-logging` to be passed on the command line to see console output. This output is now always visible in headless tests.

- Package authors will be able to specify an `atomTestRunner` field in their `package.json` containing a require path. If the field is present, Atom will resolve the path relative to the package's root, expecting the required module to export a function which it will invoke with an object containing the following parameters.
  - `testPaths` An array of paths to tests to run. Could be paths to files or directories.
  - `buildAtomEnvironment` A function that can be called to construct an instance of the `atom` global (it won't automatically be assigned to `global.atom`, that is left to the test runner to decide.
  - `logFile` An optional path to a log file to which test output should be logged.
  - `headless` A boolean indicating whether or not the tests are running headless.
  - `legacyTestRunner` This function can be invoked to run the legacy Jasmine runner, giving packages a chance to transition to a new test runner while maintaining a subset of their tests in the old environment.
- The test runner function will be expected to return a promise that resolves with an exit code. When tests are being run in headless mode Atom will exit with this code when the promise resolves. In interactive mode the promise will be ignored.
- Running tests via the `atom` CLI has been streamlined. Simply run `atom --test path1 path2` to invoke the test runner on the listed paths, expanded relative to the working directory. The `--spec-directory` option will be deprecated.
- The `buildAtomEnvironment` function will construct a clean Atom environment whose state can be reset via a call to `reset` in between test runs.

### Additional Thoughts

Atom's current testing environment has been around since the very first day of Atom development, and is quite a mess. We assign all kinds of globals and mock the clock in evil and inconsistent ways that can cause quite a few headaches when writing tests for new packages.

This PR will give us a good way to make a fresh start. Ideally, a default test runner isn't something we should be supporting in Atom core. Every package should specify its preferred runner, which it can pull in as a development dependency and which Atom can interact with via an evolving interface. It would be good to have a recommended test framework. As it stands I'd probably want to switch bundled packages over to Mocha/Chai, unless people have other suggestions. Someday in the distant future we can finally delete the tangled mess that is our current default testing environment, but we'll keep it around for now.
### Tasks
- [x] Basic clean up around test window initialization
- [x] Support specifying multiple test paths as arguments from the CLI.
- [x] Support `atomTestRunner` field containing a path.
- [x] Support multiple test paths in the default jasmine test runner.
- [x] Clean up Atom environment construction so we can instantiate the Atom environment without assigning to globals.
- [x] Pass `buildAtomEnvironment` to test runners and use it to assign the `atom` global in the default test runner, rather than in the test window initialization script.
- [x] Rename `Atom` to `AtomEnvironment`
- [x] Add a `reset` method to Atom environment
- [x] Pass `legacyTestRunner` parameter.
- [x] Fix docs generation.
- [x] Drop the `--spec-directory` CLI option
  - [ ] Stop using `--spec-directory` in `apm test` (https://github.com/atom/apm/pull/445)
  - [x] Stop using `specDirectory` parameter when running tests interactively
- [x] Drop the `Run All Tests` command from Atom since it's broken.
- [x] Shim `process.stdout.write` and `process.stderr.write` in the test window
- [x] Support a timeout flag
- [x] Expect the test runner to return a promise
- [x] Update packages to not use deprecated methods

In https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/95, I added a field `load` to the `TextBuffer`'s serialization format. I did this because previously, text-buffers would always try to load when deserializing, even if they didn't have a file! Unfortunately, when I did this, I forgot to bump the serialization format. This caused text-buffers to deserialize without loading their underlying file, which caused the above two Atom issues.

In this latest version of `text-buffer`, I remove that `load` field. It was actually somewhat redundant; a better solution is to just avoid loading when buffers don't have a `filePath`.

Currently, the `TextEditor.cutToEndOfLine` method and associated `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` command cut text from the cursor to the end of the cursor's _screen_ line. For some users, this is not the expected behavior when the cursor is in a soft wrapped line -- for those users, a more intuitive behavior would be to cut to the end of the cursor's _buffer_ line.

This PR adds a new method and command which cuts text to the end of the buffer line. Users can add a new keybinding for that or change the existing keybinding for `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` to point to the new command.

Notes:
- I decided not to change the current method `TextEditor.cutToEndOfLine` so that it cuts to the end of the buffer line because that would be considered a breaking change for that API. Still, if we consider this to be a bug in that API method, I'd be happy to change that method instead.
- I decided not to change the current command `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` so that it cuts to the end of the buffer line because that would might surprise users who are relying the current behavior. Also, `editor:select-to-end-of-line` select to the end of the screen line as well, not buffer line, so it made sense to keep these in sync (selecting and cutting to end of line should work with the same line concept so that it's not surprising for users). 
- I decided not to add a new keybinding for this command because it seemed a bit strange to have keybinding for both `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` and `editor:cut-to-end-of-buffer-line`. Normally, users wouldn't use both, they'd use one or the other. 
- I decided not to change the existing keybinding for `editor:cut-to-end-of-line` so that it calls `editor:cut-to-end-of-buffer-line` just so it doesn't surprise users who are used to the existing behavior.

I'm not 100% sure in any of those decisions above. I opened this PR to have a discussion about them -- happy to make changes if anyone feels differently.

## A Brief Flashback

Over the past month we have evaluated several strategies to attack the problem, among which:
#### iframe

Build the lines inside an `<iframe>` element and measure from them.

**Pros**: measurements happen in a separate context, completely decoupled from the current DOM. Some optimization can, therefore, be applied: skinnier DOM, less stylesheet, and so on.
**Cons**: building the lines twice has a cost which is higher than the optimizations we tried out. Moreover, we cannot alter the original DOM structure as, otherwise, measurements could be wrong. 
#### Canvas

Have a canvas element and use the `measureText` function to provide all the metrics we need to position visual elements.

**Pros**: measurements happen in a separate context and the overhead is minimal.
**Cons**: CSS typography is not fully supported (e.g. ligatures/contextual alternates get screwed up) and the risk of reporting corrupted measurements is very high.
#### No Measurements

Instead of positioning decorations, cursors, etc. with absolute coordinates, embed them inside each line and let the browser figure out all the metrics.

**Pros**: no need for measurements and more semantical HTML. In addition, this enriches the power of styling customizations (e.g. the user has the possibility to style a piece of text surrounded by a decoration).
**Cons**: worse performance, because the DOM gets more complicated and nesting increases. Overlays need to be displayed on top of lines node, which forces us to employ tricks to let them appear in front of everything. 
## The Present

In this PR we have implemented DOM-based measurements. The idea here is to append the real lines to the DOM, measure from them, and render everything else that needs measurements. 

Every time `TextEditorElement::pixelPositionForScreenPosition` or `TextEditorElement::screenPositionForPixelPosition` is called, we trigger a reflow (a bit like the DOM does when you try to read from it when its information is stale).

In `TextEditorPresenter` we update the DOM with all lines we'll need to measure before computing any state, in order to avoid multiple reflows caused by reading from line nodes more than once.

What's missing:
- [x] Autoscroll when reaching the right end of the editor.
- [x] Implement `screenPositionForPixelPosition` in `LinesYardstick`.
- [x] Fix remaining specs.
- [x] Avoid using `NodeIterator` as it is slow. Cache text nodes and measure those instead.
- [x] Evaluate if caching already computed positions yields some improvements.
- [x] Remove measurement in `TextEditorComponent::readAfterUpdateSync`.
- [x] Ensure we have no significant regression performance-wise.
- [x] Investigate why Hasklig behaves oddly.
- [x] Fix bug where the cursor disappears when moving it left/right.
- [x] :arrow_up: autocomplete-plus.
- [x] :arrow_up: wrap-guide.

If `@font-family` is undefined by a theme, then Atom will use the OS's default menu font in its place. Theme authors won't have to do anything unless they want their themes to use the OS default font - if that's the case, they need only :fire: their `@font-family` declaration.

This PR is pending changes to the One ~~and Atom~~ themes though for there to actually be an effect. :sweat_smile:

- Anyone using SF UI on anything but El Capitan will be disappointed :disappointed: (since it'll now use the OS default - Helvetica Neue on Yosemite)
- It's possible that some OS font will have weird / unexpected consequences on `line-height` / kerning that we won't necessarily be able to anticipate. If that's the case though, themes can always override the OS default if necessary.

I made the early mistake of basing Atom's initial view system, SpacePen, on jQuery, which solves a lot of problems that aren't at all relevant when targeting a single, modern browser engine. Last summer we removed the reliance on jQuery from Atom's public API and setup a pretty complicated layer of shims to keep the old jQuery-based views working through the deprecation period. With that finally behind us, this PR will remove jQuery and SpacePen entirely. We'll need to transition bundled packages away from SpacePen to finally get the benefit of reduced require time by not loading jQuery, but this is a first step.

Some things to note:
- Our default tooltips are based on bootstrap, which ships its tooltip support as a jQuery plugin. I reworked their code to remove the dependency on jQuery, which could _slightly_ alter a couple corners of the API. It would be great if people could help me test that the new tooltips work correctly in all cases.
- Some of our rarely used global spec helpers have been removed.
- The last incomplete step is to switch our test reporter from SpacePen to raw DOM APIs.

I do worry that old packages that depend on jQuery _might_ break in unforeseen ways, since we were augmenting the jQuery that shipped with SpacePen with extra stuff. For example, we had shimmed `trigger` to run Atom commands, but that no longer works. I'm not totally sure what's going to happen, but most packages developed in newer styles should have nothing to do with this.

I am relatively new to this area, so feedback is super appreciated! :bow: 

When a document had null bytes, we were previously detecting whether such bytes were paired with other characters. Thus, if we had a string like the following in the buffer:

```
{someLetter}{nullByte}{variationSelector}
```

`TokenIterator::isPairedCharacter` returned true for `{nullByte}{variationSelector}`.

Although I _suspect_ it would be technically possible for null bytes to be paired with other unicode characters, as soon as we insert a null byte into the DOM it gets ripped off. 

This screwed up our measurement mechanism, which wasn't able to match DOM positions against the model. A solution for this could have been to substitute [this line](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/lines-tile-component.coffee#L346) with:

``` coffee

Our current approach to autoscrolling when selecting with the mouse relies on the same code path as our keyboard-based autoscrolling. This makes it feel jerky and also makes it especially hard to control at small editor sizes.

This PR uses a different code path to autoscroll when selecting with the mouse, providing a smoother and more controlled experience. The scroll speed is a quadratic function of the mouse cursor's distance beyond the edge of the editor viewport, and I'm open to adjusting the parameters if anyone wants to experiment or pull something from another codebase.

After this PR, similarly to the tiles within `.lines`, we assign a decreasing `z-index` to the tiles in the gutter. We do so for `.line-number`s as well, so that we don't have to deal with DOM ordering while still solving the problem.

Among all the solutions proposed in the above issue, I feel like this is the most unobtrusive (assuming we don't want to change the visuals). Although this doesn't solve an analogous scenario (i.e. when a decoration overlaps the previous row), it fixes the pretty common issue we are observing on the gutter.

### Example

For example the editor config has:
(excerpt taken from [config-schema.coffee](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/config-schema.coffee))

``` coffeescript
...
  backUpBeforeSaving:
    type: 'boolean'

      space:
        type: ['boolean', 'string']
        default: '\u00b7'

        type: ['boolean', 'string']
        default: '\u00bb'

      cr:
        type: ['boolean', 'string']
        default: '\u00a4'
        maximumLength: 1
...
```

A call to `atom.config.get('editor')` returns an object with an 'invisibles' value that is an empty object. We are expecting an object containing the default values for the properties in 'invisibles'. 

This result is caused by `_.defaults()` in `@getRawValue()` not being recursive. The lack of a `_.deepDefaults()` lead me to use a bit of a workaround with `_.deepExtends()`. Now with `_.deepExtends()`, the default values are the base while any new values read from the config.cson overwrite the defaults. This way all default values, even nested ones, appear in the result.
### Side-Effect

A side effect of this issue was that atom/settings-view does not properly present the available configuration options from the config schema. The `appendObject()` method in [settings-view/lib/settings-panel.coffee](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/blob/5a115f9e051da32e7af676daf6076d890d8d5e75/lib/settings-panel.coffee) uses the values provided by `config.get(packageName)`. The lack of keys in the value provided to appendObject would lead to objects in the schema disappearing from the SettingsPanel. With this proposed change, the SettingsPanel now properly displays objects and their properties.

When opening already opened file via `atom.workspace.open(path,{ initialLine: 0,  initialColumn: 0, searchAllPanes: true} )`, cursor position doesn't move to `row : 0, column:0`.

Check below screenshot. 
I run code on console.

``` javascript
var indexPath = ""/Users/yomybaby/Documents/AWorkspace/demo-atom-package/app/controllers/index.js""
setInterval(function(){
  atom.workspace.open( indexPath , {initialLine:0, initialColumn:0, searchAllPanes:true});

## Expected result:

Whether or not file is opened already, cursor position has to be [0,0].

Same result of below code

``` javascript
var indexPath = ""/Users/yomybaby/Documents/AWorkspace/demo-atom-package/app/controllers/index.js""

This PR changes our approach to creating and manipulating multiple selections with the mouse. Previously, as soon as selections started overlapping we merged them, but this led to unintuitive behavior when dragging with the mouse, where existing selections would snap to the current pointer location. It also created inconsistencies when the first selection was wordwise or linewise.

In this PR, we defer selection merging during dragging. You can drag a new selection to overlap an existing one, then change your mind and still leave the old selection intact. As soon as you release the mouse button, selections are merged as normal.

As a temporary stopgap measure until we explore better alternatives, we have decided to tackle the above issue by putting tiles upper in the stack in front of the ones below.

Previously document polling happened through timed intervals causing continued use of CPU when the editor was unfocused. 

This PR changes the polling to occur when the DOM is mutated or the window is resized (since that doesn't fall under a DOM mutation). Additionally it changes the way Atom updates the CSS so that it occurs as a mutation and the event is captured. Furthermore! It prevents the cursor from ever starting to blink if it wasn't blinking already which can be caused, for instance, when content is changed in the Settings View.

We've added test coverage but are still testing this branch out to be sure we've:
- covered all the DOM changing scenarios
- not added additional CPU usage when editor _is_ active

Now it seems a little weird to me to have a `decreaseNextIndentPattern` match an empty line and by that make the next line decrease it's indent level, but it seems some language packages (tried to) do exactly that before #6808 with the `decreaseIndentPattern`.

While this could have worked for some, IMO it only worked because of the logic error/problem that was changed/fixed in #6808.

So this change enables such a use case again, and even in a much more predicable and exact way. And of course it's also true that if the empty line does _not_ match the `increaseIndentPattern` or `decreaseNextIndentPattern` (which will be the case in most cases) this change will have no effect except for the fact that the also the empty line is now also matched against the regexp's.

As for the tests... I didn't add any new ones for this use case because currently no language package is using this. The issue https://github.com/atom-haskell/language-haskell/issues/40 and some discussion on Gitter lead me to this change/fix as it seems at least the `langange-haskell` package would like to use it. But until (if) they actually do, I cannot write a test for this I think... All existing tests do still pass and I worked with it for a day now and didn't notice any side effects...

The GPU layer added to the .gutter .tiles cause the surounding UI to also composite layers, like the tas or the status-bar. This disables subpixel anti-aliasing and text doesn't look that sharp.

Eventhough the `.gutter` has `overflow: hidden`, it seems Chrome still thinks there is a chance of overlapping and thus creates the extra layers.
### Solution

Creating an own stacking context with `z-index` for the `.gutter` seems to fix it.

#### Building with io.js v2.x is not supported

**Resolution**: Do not update npm. The version shipped with io.js is patched to work around the problems with node-gyp.

Any attempt to execute `script/build` when using io.js v2.x fails with

#### Crash caused by invalid memory access during exit/closing window

**Resolution**: Solved in Electron v0.30.2.
[Full crash log](https://gist.github.com/thomasjo/8080e027a291c9402292).
The problem is a bit tricky to reproduce, but when it occurs it happens when a window is closed or when exiting Atom, which leads me to believe the problem is related to storing state. Seems like the crash is caused by a `nullptr` reference.
#### 8 failing spec assertions

#### In OS X closing all windows exits the application

**Resolution**: Side-effect of crashing problem. Resolved in Electron v0.30.2.

When running against atom-shell v0.22.3 Atom behaves as expected and leaves the application running even after all application windows have been closed. When running against Electron v0.30.0 however, after all windows have been closed the application exits.
#### Building on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS) is failing due to compilation errors

**Resolution**: Using GCC 4.7+, or Clang 3.0+. Also fixed in CI by ensuring the usage of Clang instead of GCC.

Attempts to build on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (64-bit) fails while compiling npm modules, throwing errors similar to

```

/home/travis/.atom/.node-gyp/.node-gyp/0.30.1/deps/v8/include/v8.h:922:1: error: expected unqualified-id before ‚Äòusing‚Äô
```

The compilation failure is caused by the fact that GCC 4.7 or newer is required due to V8 using the _template alias_ feature in C++, and that is not supported in GCC 4.6.3 which is the newest GCC (officially) available in Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS.

**Solution**: Compile with Clang 3.4 on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS;

```
$ sudo apt-get install clang-3.4
$ CXX=clang++ script/build
```

For Travis CI support, we should specify `compiler: clang` in `.travis.yml`. (http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/c/#Choosing-compilers-to-test-against)
#### Failing settings-view specs

#### apm builds incompatible native modules.

**Resolution**: Solved by apm v1.0.3.

When apm builds native modules they end up incompatible with Atom. See https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/7877#issuecomment-127031350 for more details.
## Other potential problems
1. ~~Currently it does not seem like it's possible to use this build of Atom as a Git editor; closing the spawned window does not result in the process exiting as expected it seems like, and thus leaves the Git terminal process waiting for the input sequence to end.  
   This is possibly related to issue _In OS X closing all windows exits the application_.~~ Resolved by upgrading to Electron v0.30.2.

- The inclusion of change counts in exception metadata. Every time the buffer changes, we'll increment a count.

This takes an approach more similar to @driskell's original PR (#5658), but we continue to use floating point numbers for the indent level. When hard tabs are enabled, we handle the fractional portion of the indent level by appending an appropriate number of trailing spaces.

A huge huge thanks to @driskell for identifying the issue and taking action to fix it. I used a slightly adapted version of his test case in this PR, but took a different approach to solving the problem.

Previously, we allowed a mix of tabs and spaces to be counted toward the indentation of a line. This caused problems when auto-indenting lines in a hard-tabbed file that contained ‚Äúalignment spaces‚Äù, such as occurs in aligned comment blocks. For this case, it makes more sense to assume that the line is indented via tabs only, and consider the subsequent alignment space as part of the line‚Äôs content. This means it's actually more correct to only consider tabs **or** spaces, but not both when reading or updating a line's indentation.

Until now, in order to solve these kinds of mysteries, our only option other than raw luck with reproduction steps or a brilliant stroke of insight was to be more aggressive about throwing exceptions when getting into an invalid state. But, of course, we're extremely reluctant to do that because who wants to introduce an even greater chance of throwing an exception?!

This PR enables a better approach by adding a new tool to our box: `atom.assert`. This global method takes a condition, a description message, and an optional metadata callback as follows:

``` coffee
atom.assert a is b, ""a is b"", -> {a, b}
```

Now, whenever we have uncaught exceptions, our goal should be as follows:
- If appropriate, do something to suppress the exception. This may lead to other, weirder errors, but we also may survive without the user ever noticing. This is obviously an extremely short-term strategy, and it will need to be applied judiciously.
- Start forming hypotheses and seasoning in efficient-to-run assertions that can investigate how and where things might be going wrong. This will enable us to start chasing errors to their source as we put out releases.

An example of this approach is included in this PR, referencing #5905.

@atom/feedback Once we start doing this, it could be fairly important to know if an assertion has failed when someone is reporting a bug. We'll be reporting assertion failures to bugsnag and logging them to the console. Do we want some other indicator? My main thing is that we need to be able to insert assertions without interrupting a user's flow.

It's also worth noting that this changes the API of `atom.onDidThrowError` to yield the entire `Error` object to subscribers. It's made backward-compatible by adding the old event properties to the error object. I found no packages that use this method, so it should be pretty safe to change this.

@nathansobo: this PR can be merged without addressing the above proposal, but I am curious about your :thought_balloon: on this. My two cents are that we should go for 2), as it‚Äôs kinda pointless to always create new instances as proposed in 1). I am sure, though, that there are good reasons for that behavior to exist  and it‚Äôd be great if you could share your thoughts about them.

7324,2,4,0,Internals,maxbrunsfeld,2015-06-17T19:41:59Z,41,17,4,0,"Previously, when pasting text with the `Auto Indent on Paste` setting enabled, the indentation of the affected lines would always be adjusted afterwards based on the language's 'suggested indentation'. This would sometimes have the effect of undoing the paste!

Now, this adjustment is _only_ performed if the pasted text spans more than one line. I believe this matches the behavior of TextMate, which I find to be very intuitive.

Also, while fixing this, I noticed an unrelated bug where the `decreaseIndentPattern` would sometimes incorrectly fail to match, because it was being tested against the version of the text with invisible characters substituted. For example, when invisibles are enabled, leading spaces are displayed as `‚Ä¢`. The regex was being tested against the displayed string instead of the buffer's actual contents. This would cause [language-html's](https://github.com/atom/language-html/blob/94e850dc4ab848baac1f413e4cb864864e1c24f8/settings/language-html.cson#L14) and [language-javascript's](https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/blob/601cb6cb8f80e03e7eaa5695515d6366fb2b6d18/settings/language-javascript.cson#L11) decrease-indent-patterns to fail to match.

We started noticing that when a `TextEditor` pane got split, the same view for `Gutter` was being shared amongst several models, thereby making the same DOM element accessible simultaneously by more than one object. This made us experience _orphaned line numbers_, caused by two instances of `LineNumberGutterComponent` mutating `.line-numbers` at the same time.

This is a typical race condition which I would normally address by understanding and possibly locking the correct order in which operations should happen. However, I believe in this situation we shouldn‚Äôt actually care about ordering at all, since I think views should be kept ‚Äúlocal‚Äù, thus avoiding to expose them to the world and/or reusing them across other views (either accidentally as in this case or on purpose).

@jssln @nathansobo: I assume the `ViewRegistry` came into play because it was handy to get the view straight from `atom.views.getView`. If this is the use case and I am not missing something, we may expose a method under `TextEditorElement` which, in turn, would interrogate `TextEditorComponent` to fetch the related DOM node.

**Before**: The default is `Inconsolata`, but only if it's installed. If not, the fallback font is `Monaco`. The problem is that Inconsolata is quite smaller than other fonts, making it look bigger when changing the font in the settings. Or it's already too big when Inconsolata isn't installed. It's also a problem in mini editors.

**After**: New default is `Menlo`.
- Much closer to other fonts.
- Already comes preinstalled with OS X from Snow Leopard or newer.
- Is also the default in other editors/applications, like Xcode.

![default-font](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/8155190/b9f42d94-137c-11e5-8bf0-714972431662.gif)

Text in mini editors in some/most themes will look bigger. But they already do that, if Inconsolata isn't installed or if a user changes the font in the settings. So with this change, themes hopefully make the `@input-font-size` a bit smaller and then it would be more consistent with other fonts.

![screen shot 2015-06-15 at 4 16 11 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/8155386/b3b808ae-137e-11e5-8327-51b88e79c72c.png)
### Possible alternatives
1. `Monaco`. It's the current fallback font if Inconsolata is not installed.
   - Pro: Less people would be affected by this change.
   - Con: Monaco doesn't have _italic_ and _bold_ version, which some themes use. Also in MD files. Menlo is newer and arguably more legible.
2. Bundle a new default font (see: #4201).
   - Pro: Could be any font, not just a system font. Would be consistent across all platforms.
   - Con: Even more users would be affected (also Win+Linux). Staying close to the platform might be a good idea because people are already used to that font from other editors/applications. Like Xcode uses Menlo and Visual Studio uses Consolas, in Atom it would be the same.
### Who is affected?
- Users that haven't changed the Font Family in the settings and have Inconsolata installed or are on OS X.
- Users that haven't changed the Font Size in the settings.
- Users that haven't changed the Line Height in the settings.
### I prefer the old default

For users that prefer the old default, it can be changed back in the settings to:
- Font Family: `Inconsolata, Monaco, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace`
- Font Size: `16`
- Line Height: `1.3`

### Less Is More

The lion's share of overhead when working with text files goes to supporting the following features:
- Soft wrap
- Folds
- Syntax analysis

As files get larger, this overhead becomes more problematic. Yes, we can reduce this overhead and plan to do so, but it's also true that these features are less likely to be critical when editing really huge files. So this PR disables them for files above 2MB.

In return we can do the following:
- Compute placeholder `TokenizedLine`s on demand instead of up-front. This skips all of the processing I was trying to perform in the background on #7060, which can now be closed. It also avoids the memory hit of storing horizontal spatial metadata for any lines we haven't yet viewed. I'm leaving lines cached once we compute them once to avoid creating the same line over and over again. We could potentially use an LRU (""least recently used"") cache eviction strategy if we want to cap consumed memory, but I'm not sure it's worth prioritizing.
- Delegate straight through to `TokenizedBuffer` from `DisplayBuffer` rather than storing a second copy of lines, since there are no folds and soft wraps. This isn't a huge win but it does avoid an extra potentially huge array of references.
- Not block the UI thread as we perform the initial tokenization. This is really long overdue to be backgrounded, but this is a good stopgap.
### Metrics

Now that we've cleared a huge bottleneck, new bottlenecks are revealing themselves in the initial load of a large file. At least on an SSD, I/O really isn't high on the list yet. Here's a flame graph for loading that 18.5 MB file:

<img width=""1318"" alt=""screenshot_2015-06-05_22_11_18"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/8014847/6b37b540-0bd4-11e5-94f9-0d91da9083e6.png"">

There's plenty of low hanging :apple: in here. I've highlighted a few things that stood out to me.

@maxbrunsfeld: `TextBuffer` might be a good first candidate for `Patch` after all, at least in terms of getting that data structure optimized for insertion. `SpanSkipList` insertion is by far the biggest remaining cost.

From a memory perspective, the `SpanSkipList` is also our biggest offender when `TokenizedLine`s are out of the way:

_To see the difference, please have a look at them at full-screen. Benchmarks were performed using the following script on `text-editor-component-spec.coffee`:_

``` coffee
startBenchmark: (time=10, delta=250) ->
  @benchmarkInterval = setInterval(->
    document.querySelector(""html /deep/ .editor-contents--private"").dispatchEvent(new WheelEvent(""mousewheel"", wheelDeltaY: -delta))
  , time)
```

Chrome further confirms we have a ~50% speedup on paint times:

A byproduct of this change is that we'll be able to paint more than ~750k lines! :tada: 

I took the chance to extract out a `TiledComponent` which aims to cleanly abstract away all the complexity of creating a tile on screen and moving it up and down. I think there is a similar duplication in `TextEditorPresenter` but I'd like to a wait a bit more before introducing an abstraction in there, too.
### What's missing
- [x] Find a better name for `TileComponent` (it clashes with `TiledComponent`). I think we should keep the latter and get rid of the former, e.g. `TileComponent -> LinesTileComponent`.
- [x] Adjust existing specs to support this new behavior
- [x] Spec coverage for tiling (having a reusable contract test for this one seems like a good path, as we can use it for every `TiledComponent`)
- [x] Make sure custom gutters continue to work. @jssln: I think nothing huge should be screwed up with this PR (although changes like the one in `gutter-component-helpers.coffee` look suspicious), but you did a great job on the gutter and I'd :heart: to have your feedback :bow: 
- [x] Uncomment `if @newState.maxLineNumberDigits isnt @oldState.maxLineNumberDigits` and handle that scenario
- [x] Refine `text-editor-presenter-spec.coffee`'s tests names

This is one of several optimizations aimed at addressing Atom's slowness when an editor has a lot  of markers (e.g. find-and-replace results, spell-check highlights).
#### Problem

Currently, each decorated marker in the editor is individually observed by the `TextEditorPresenter` using `Marker::onDidChange`. Even though the presenter doesn't do much work for markers that are off-screen, just emitting all these change events becomes expensive when there are 10,000+ markers. The main cost is computing each marker's screen coordinates based on the underlying buffer coordinates.

This is a flame graph taken while inserting a newline into a file 2800 line file with 17000 search results. It took **1.5 seconds**. The region between the red arrows is emitting marker change events.

#### Solution

~~We've added a new API on `TextEditor` called `::observeMarkers()`, which allows you to observe any marker changes within a particular region of the editor.~~ The presenter now simply recomputes decoration states whenever any markers update. It determines that markers have updated using the text-buffer's `::onDidUpdateMarkers` method. This means that most markers are not observed, so they can avoid observing changes to their underlying `text-buffer` marker, preventing unnecessary screen-coordinate translations.

The same operation as performed above now takes **170 ms**. Still not fast, but we've removed a bottleneck.

Previously, when keystrokes bound to `unset!` corresponded to commands in the application menu, the commands were getting run anyway due to the operating system's processing of the keyboard shortcut present in the menu. This omits any `unset!` commands from the application menu to prevent that from happening.

This is more general than I would like. If the keystroke is unset in any context, we err on the side of caution and don‚Äôt add it to the application menu for any command. Since our application menu isn‚Äôt context aware, this should be good enough for now and solve the 80% case. Someday we should make the application menu update / gray out options when the focused element changes. Only then would we be able to precisely determine that a binding was unset in a given context, because we would have an element. Without an element it's just guess-work because who knows when a selector will match.

This PR migrates Atom to use the latest source Bootstrap instead of Atom's outdated fork of Bootstrap. There's really no need for Atom's fork anymore because the `viewport` option was added to source Bootstrap awhile ago, and that's all we were using the fork for anyway.

_Note: this doesn't mean Atom won't still be moving away from Bootstrap eventually, but Atom does heavily rely on it for such components as tooltips, so upgrading it is still a good idea._

This caused `TokenizedLine`s to consume much more memory than is strictly necessary.

This PR switches `TokenizedLine` to a much more compact (but also more cryptic) representation. Instead of repeating the scopes on each token, we instead represent the entire tokenized line as a _nested word_, which intermingles start and end tags with text much like HTML.

Consider the following JavaScript fragment:

``` js
function() {}
```

Previously, we would store this as an array of tokens, each with an array of its containing scopes:

``` js
[
  {value: 'function', scopes: ['source.js', 'meta.function.js', 'storage.type.function.js']},
  {value: ' ', scopes: ['source.js', 'meta.function.js']},
  {value: '(', scopes: ['source.js', 'meta.function.js', 'punctuation.definition.parameters.begin.js']},
  {value: ')', scopes: ['source.js', 'meta.function.js', 'punctuation.definition.parameters.end.js']},
  {value: ' ', scopes: ['source.js', 'meta.function.js']},
  {value: '{', scopes: ['source.js', 'punctuation.section.scope.begin.js']},
  {value: '}', scopes: ['source.js', 'punctuation.section.scope.end.js']}
]
```

Now this is stored more like HTML, with strings intermingled with scope start / end tags.

``` js
// Note: This JSON is just for example purposes. Read below for the actual representation.

[
  {start: 'source.js'},
    {start: 'meta.function.js'},
      {start: 'storage.type.function.js'},
        ""function"",
      {end: 'storage.type.function.js'},
      "" "",
      {start: 'punctuation.definition.parameters.begin.js'},
        ""("",
      {end: 'punctuation.definition.parameters.begin.js'},
      {start: 'punctuation.definition.parameters.end.js'},
        "")"",
      {end: 'punctuation.definition.parameters.end.js'},
    {end: 'meta.function.js'},
    "" "",
    {start: 'punctuation.section.scope.begin.js'},
      ""{"",
    {end: 'punctuation.section.scope.begin.js'},
    {start: 'punctuation.section.scope.end.js'},
      ""}"",
    {end: 'punctuation.section.scope.end.js'},
  // note 'source.js' isn't closed yet
]
```

This may look more verbose, but it eliminates the need to repeat the same scopes on successive tokens in the same branch of the syntax tree. In actuality, the scopes are encoded as simple arrays of integers. Negative integers indicate start and end tags, with odd integers being start tags and even integers being end tags for the odd integer preceding them. Positive integers stand in for strings. The integers can be translated back to scope strings by consulting a lookup table on the grammar registry. We retain the original string and combine the two pieces of data as needed.

So in reality, the stored representation looks like this.

``` js
{
  text: ""function() {}"",
  tags: [-1, -3, -5, 8, -6, 1, -7, 1, -8, -9, 1, -10, -4, 1, -11, 1, -12, -13, 1, -14]
}
```
### Measurements

Here are some heap snapshots taken with `benchmark/fixtures/huge.js` in the Atom repository. This file is just a copy of jQuery 1.7.1, but has some good examples of lines with extremely complex scope structures.

First, on master:

![screenshot 2015-05-14 19 07 26](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/7637260/e40779b6-fa6c-11e4-8441-ef42af5e8f9f.png)

`TokenizedLine` instances consume over 27MB. The largest instance is expanded in the screenshot, where you can see the vast majority of the memory for that line being consumed by the `tokens` array (~25KB). Repeat that for thousands of lines and you can see the problem.

Now, the same file on this branch:

![screenshot 2015-05-14 19 09 57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/7637303/40a52bdc-fa6d-11e4-88b3-e64479cccda3.png)

Still more memory than I'd like to consume, but much less, around 8.4MB. You can see that the `tags` array takes up much less space than the `tokens` array, but still more than it seems like it should. I can save more with typed arrays, but only about 500KB in my experiment.

JS objects still seem to impose a frustrating amount of overhead. Starting to wonder if we want to drop some of our low-level storage structures to C++, but I'd rather improve the structure of this layer before contemplating that. The `TokenizedLine` instances are also now much simpler objects, meaning they terminate in primitives much more quickly. I wonder if this helps the GC in that the heap is simpler and there are fewer objects to trace. This is just speculation however.
### Steps
- [x] Get core specs passing with new representation
- [x] Eliminate usages of the `tokens` array shim in core, which creates a lot of garbage
- [x] Post some heap snapshot comparisons
- [x] Publish a new major revision of first-mate and link it in package.json
- [x] Ensure all package specs pass
- [x] Switch hot package paths off the tokens shim

The problem in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6713 was that the keybinding for `window:increase-font-size` is `cmd-+`, but Electron doesn't accept `+` characters in keystrokes -- [it accepts `Plus`](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/accelerator.md#available-key-codes). 29a4ab1 fixes this by detecting `+` keys and switching them with `Plus`. 

![screen shot 2015-05-11 at 14 08 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/38924/7564463/3426c966-f7e7-11e4-819e-fbe6ab41fbc2.png)

Another thing I noticed is that keystrokes are split on `-` (which is the separator Atom uses), which causes problems for keystrokes which use `-` as the key. For example, `window:decrease-font-size` has `cmd--` as one of its keybindings. The reason why this problem doesn't manifest currently is that [`window:decrease-font-size` has two keybindings currently](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/f1f8c3d0a72de7d20bcde4fd145261c34d3e7462/keymaps/darwin.cson#L79-L80), and the second one is getting picked when constructing the menu (the one which doesn't use `-`):

```
  'cmd--': 'window:decrease-font-size'
  'cmd-_': 'window:decrease-font-size'
```

If you remove that second keybinding, the menu entry for `Decrease font size` will not have a keystroke as well. 71fba99 fixes this by splitting the keystroke on `-`, but only if there's another character after it (so, it doesn't split on trailing `-`).

I tried to figure out how to write tests for this, but failed. :disappointed: @kevinsawicki @maxbrunsfeld if you have some :hourglass: to point me in the right direction -- I'd be happy to add those.

It does so by organizing them into tiles, which we then move up and down through a compositing transformation. The main advantage is that paint times dramatically reduce, because now we simply need to paint a small tile, instead of all the lines. This is especially noticeable during scrolling which, as a result, will be the subject of the benchmarks I am going to show later on.

Please, note that:
- [x] Specs are broken. The solution you can see here was achieved by spiking a bunch of ideas, and therefore I didn't pay attention to change specs/code gradually. As a result, I plan to adapt previous specs and write some new ones as soon as possible.
- [x] There's some evident structural duplication in code. However, I'd like to start refactoring that stuff as soon as I have unit tests to prevent naive errors.
- [x] Naming-wise I am not entirely happy with `TilesPresenter` and `LinesPresenter` and they're probably going to change. Any suggestion or improvement is very welcome here.
- I have intentionally left out line numbers from using this new approach. I'd like to keep this PR focused and work on that right after :ship:ping this one.

:racehorse: And now some benchmarks! :racehorse:
## Benchmarks

Tests conducted using:
- A `1920x1080` window
- `editor.scrollSensitivity = 130`
- A custom code (associated to a keyboard key) to simulate `mouseWheel` events
  
  ``` coffee
  document.querySelector(""html /deep/ .editor-contents--private"").dispatchEvent(new WheelEvent(""mousewheel"", wheelDeltaY: -250))
  ```
- Keyboard Key Repeat: `Fast` (Mac OS X setting)
- Delay Until Repeat: `Short` (Mac OS X setting)

I needed a (more or less) repeatable way to benchmark scrolling. To try this out, you can simply scroll up and down as you would normally do.

### Why this matters?

As you can notice, paint times are dramatically reduced. This may not be noticeable with your :eyes:, but it's nevertheless important 'cause it leaves some room for additional operations (such as a more expensive character measurement computation). As said earlier, things are going to speed up further once we introduce tiling for line numbers as well.

It would be great if you could try this out, reporting any eventual regression or glitch that I may have overlooked while implementing the tiling strategy. Moreover, any code review or additional :eyes: are always welcome.

Thank you!

As you might imagine, this leads to difficult maintenance and introducing regressions becomes much easier. :fearful:

That said, this layer is not intrinsically convoluted and, therefore, I think we have some chance to make it better. This PR attempts to bring some clarity to one aspect @nathansobo pointed during a conversation and which I totally agree with.

When dealing with batching, I introduced an helper function (`@batch`) which enabled me to, more or less, decorate a function and have it batched automagically. While this removed a bit of duplication, it didn't improve code quality at all, making the batching process look a bit opaque.

The intent of this PR is to replace this mechanism with a simpler one, which solely relies on booleans. I have payed attention to preserve the original behavior but, as illustrated earlier on, it's easy to overlook mistakes and it would be great if you could try this out to spot regressions of any kind. (/cc: @atom/feedback)

Going forward I think that the path should be to split `TextEditorPresenter` into many smaller objects (e.g. one for lines, one for gutters, etc... maybe the structure could even match how we currently organize _UI Components_). This way `TextEditorPresenter` could act as the glue which makes those smaller presenters stick together. If we follow this design I think we can make our test suite even more precise (i.e. keep some integration tests in `TextEditorPresenter` and test each component separately). @nathansobo: what are your :thought_balloon: on this?

My plan is to achieve this incrementally :footprints:: this PR is just the first, tiny step; as we touch related areas of this code we should take the time to give them some :heart:.

Currently, there's no special `Grim.deprecate` call for the old context menu CSON format -- it's being detected [within `ContextMenuManager.add()`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/14161a63fe1b56aed834050bd8bb56180e6acfb3/src/context-menu-manager.coffee#L115-L123), which is called from [`Package.activateResources()`](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/14161a63fe1b56aed834050bd8bb56180e6acfb3/src/package.coffee#L194). So, the `Grim.deprecate` call within `ContextMenuManager.add()` catches both calls to `ContextMenuManager.add()` from packages (adding menu items after activation) and calls to `ContextMenuManager.add()` from Atom when it adds menu items from packages' cson file at activation.

For that reason, the `Grim.deprecate` call in cases when `ContextMenuManager.add()` is called from Atom at package activation is incorrectly attributed to Atom itself. Also, the deprecation text is a bit confusing because it says that `ContextMenuManager.add()` was called, but the package didn't make such a call directly.

This PR adds a new `Grim.deprecate` call to `Package.activateResources()` _before_ `ContextMenuManager.add()` is called. This catches the old-context-menu-CSON-format situation so that it is correctly attributed to packages and a clearer message can be shown. In addition, the conversion from the old format to the new format happens in `Package.activateResources()` as well so that the `Grim.deprecate` call within `ContextMenuManager.add()` isn't triggered in that case. The `Grim.deprecate` call within `ContextMenuManager.add()` wasn't removed because it still needs to catch direct calls to that public method from packages.

@kevinsawicki @maxbrunsfeld I moved the two calls mentioned in the comment above :point_up: and that resolved the problem for those two calls. Here's how those two deprecations look now in Deprecation Cop:

:sparkles: -- notice that they are attributed to pdf-view, not to Atom core.

However, there are two other `Grim.deprecate` calls which are still being incorrectly attributed to Atom core -- the ones which check if the value returned from `onDidChangeModified` and `onDidChangeTitle` are `Disposable`s. 

![screen shot 2015-04-22 at 15 31 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/38924/7276006/59974f52-e907-11e4-9542-b5b935d43f1d.png)

Those two calls are [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ecd04446434e47c505d7f1d3d8cb0fb76e91aa64/src/pane-view.coffee#L119) and [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ecd04446434e47c505d7f1d3d8cb0fb76e91aa64/src/pane-view.coffee#L128). As far as I can tell, I can't apply the same approach to these because they check if the _return value_ has a specific type. So it needs to stay there, I _think_.

Also, the ""magic"" which helps us solve the problem for the two deprecations in this PR is that we explicitly pass a package name to Grim.deprecate to tell it what package is involved. That ""magic"" is implemented in [atom.workspace.getCallingPackageName()](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/ecd04446434e47c505d7f1d3d8cb0fb76e91aa64/src/workspace.coffee#L483). So, I tried calling this method from `pane-view.onActiveItemChanged()`, where the two deprecations checking for a `Disposable` return values are located, but that call returned `undefined`.

I'm not sure how to fix those two deprecations -- would love your help with those, if you have ideas. :pray: Also, maybe we can just remove them?

When we change config values rapidly, we end up detecting our own changes to the user config file, causing a load to be requested. If we have made changes to the config since the last write that haven't yet been saved, our changes end up getting clobbered when the stale values are loaded. My simple solution is to just never load values from disk when there are unsaved changes pending.

This is actually a pretty nuanced problem to get right in the general case, and reminds me of the kinds of problems databases deal with. The sync API backed by async persistence is especially tricky. But I think for our limited case, it should be fine to suppress loading config for a brief window when we're about to write to it again.

First of all, you can reproduce some of the failures mentioned in the previous issue by simply checking out **master** and focusing on a `SelectListView` spec and a failing spec on `TextEditorComponent`, e.g.:

To be fair, this doesn't always cause the specs to fail: in 90% of the cases, though, it does on my machine so I assume it does on yours as well. Running the command below will help if you still cannot reproduce the error:

``` bash
$ sudo nice -n -20 stress --io 8 --cpu 8
```

Back to the randomly failing tests! :fire: 
### Why did they fail, then?

Our `spec-helper` is supposed to clear all the state from previous tests during `beforeEach` and `afterEach`: in practice, however, it doesn't do so for `setInterval` and `clearInterval`. The specs which use those two methods, either directly or indirectly, need to make sure to clean the state themselves or even mock those functions if they need them to write a particular expectation.

Specifically, the root of the failures resided in a dirty `ViewRegistry` which contained an active `setInterval` function instantiated by the previous SUT (e.g. `SelectListView` uses a `TextEditorView`, which in turn uses a `TextEditorComponent`, which in turn uses a `ViewRegistry` via `@pollDocument`) and which were being triggered during `TextEditorComponent` tests. The reason why they presented to ourselves in a randomized fashion, was because the _unmocked_ `setInterval` method was used during `SelectListView` specs and the system triggered the timeout independently from our `advanceClock`.
### A solution

My first reaction was to always mock `setInterval` and `clearInterval`, as `TextEditorComponent` does, in our `spec-helper`, but then I noticed this in `text-editor-presenter-spec.coffee`:

``` coffee
# These *should* be mocked in the spec helper, but changing that now would break packages :-(
spyOn(window, ""setInterval"").andCallFake window.fakeSetInterval
spyOn(window, ""clearInterval"").andCallFake window.fakeClearInterval
```
- A quick workaround could be to mock such methods only while running core tests. The question is: do we have a way to recognize when we're in such environment?
- An alternative could be to mock those two methods in `select-list-view-spec`, but we wouldn't use them at all for our test assertions and I'd love not to bother with this stuff every time we deal with a SUT which uses those methods internally (also because we may not be aware of that).

That said, I have decided to put a `@stopPollingDocument` right inside `ViewRegistry#clearDocumentRequests` which, to be fair, seems a quite reasonable tradeoff to me. This seems to have fixed those spurious errors once for all (https://travis-ci.org/atom/atom/jobs/58576153) and I cannot reproduce them locally anymore :tada:

Please note that, although my ultimate goal is to make every spec bullet-proof, the changes here proposed are deliberately not comprehensive: there are a bunch of other tests which need to be inspected (see #6274) but I think it's better to address each of them incrementally, without creating gargantuan pull requests.

Also, I think this highlights the importance of running specs on every platform: even though all the tests hereby addressed were failing because of a bug in the test itself (and not in our production code), there's a quite high risk of introducing bugs on other platforms without noticing it.

I think that's great -- it allows users to quickly report issues. However, it doesn't assist users in creating a good bug report or feature request. We've noticed lots of issues created without even basic information such as Atom version, OS, expected behavior, and screenshots. 

This PR changes the in-app menu option to instead point users to the [CONTRIBUTING guide section on submitting issues](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-issues). That section explains which information users should include in issues and also points them to the debugging guide. This will introduce an additional step in the process for creating issues, but it will hopefully result in higher quality issues which are easier to triage (and fix). :pray: 

Also, I slightly updated the CONTRIBUTING guide to state this goal more clearly, include a link to the New Issue form in the first bullet, and point to package repositories in the section on submitting issues. The CONTRIBUTING guide will see a lot more updates in the near future, this is just a first step.

Before these changes, when a line contained multiple selections and `deleteLine()` was called, two lines would have been deleted instead of just one. This happens because, when the line containing the first selection is deleted, the other selection doesn't get destroyed but it simply moves.

This PR tries to fix this by merging selections that have intersecting rows. However, I do feel like there may be some other elegant solutions to this: I am thinking to something like `Marker` invalidation, for example.

### Notes
- The overlay parent is the `atom-text-editor`. The editor and containing pane are now both `overflow: visible`. This allows the pane item the flexibility to have things jump out if necessary.
- When bumping up against the left or right edge of the window, the overlay will _shift_ horizontally, not flip. This always keeps it in the window frame. Shifting felt more natural than flipping.
- When bumping up against the bottom edge of the window, the overlay will flip. It will not necessarily be always visible in the window frame (due to scrolling), but does its best with the flip.
- A `left-margin` is supported on the overlay. It will take the margin into account when doing the window bounds-checking. Note the blue box in the first image has a `-250px` left margin.
- In the future, it would be nice to allow configuration of the shift or flip, or bounds checking at all, but for right now, keeping it simple.

So things like `atom.workspaceView` will be unavailable and so you can use this flag to test out that your packages will work correctly when 1.0 comes out.

The basic flow here is to check `Grim.includeDeprecatedAPIs` in places and to co-locate all the prototype methods at the bottom of the file so they can all be deleted easily once 1.0 ships.

As pointed out on the aforementioned issue, Atom behaved unexpectedly while soft-wrapping tab-indented lines. I tracked down the issue to `TokenizedLine#findWrapColumn`: when searching backwards for spaces, in facts, the method didn't skip indentation tokens.

But why this was happening only for tab-indented lines? That's because invisibles were getting replaced with visible characters. However, the replacement for `\t` has a trailing space `¬ª`, whereas the replacement for spaces hasn't.

This PR changes the behavior to always skip indentation tokens while scanning the line backwards for spaces :beetle: :gun:

As reported on the issue, Atom behaved inconsistently while adding selections (above or below) on lines made of tokens with a `screenDelta > bufferDelta` (e.g. tabs). The behavior was not compatible with Sublime Text, too, which handles the scenario like this:
- Selecting above or below works with what's visible on screen (thus, no mismatch between buffer length and screen length)
- Soft-wrapped lines are therefore included while selecting
- When a soft-wrapped line has indentation, skip it and select the first real character

This is the behavior I would expect in Atom as well and, hopefully, this PR includes everything that's needed to achieve it :fire:

Thanks to @izuzak for making this issue reproducible for everyone. Great job, seriously! :clap: 

Unfortunately, #5883 is caused by something different than #5667: if you try to checkout `v0.180` (where the issue originally appeared) you'll find out that the reproducing steps provided by @izuzak won't cause any problem. Therefore, I'd like to apologize with every Atom user for this issue (I am truly sorry if this has caused headaches to you :pray:), because this has been caused by our batching strategy. 

When there is only one pane, everything goes smoothly and no error occurs. However, when there's more than one (and with some particular packages enabled), our `TextEditorPresenter` goes out-of-sync, thus causing that annoying `No line exists for row #{row}. Last screen row: #{@model.getLastScreenRow()}` error. This happens because:
- Something change in the underlying buffer
- `getState` gets called before `updateStartRow` and `updateEndRow` (which would be triggered by a change in the buffer)
- `updateLinesState` tries to traverse an obsolete row range

For symmetry with `@updateState`, I opted to simply include `@updateContentDimensions`, `@updateScrollbarDimensions`, `@updateStartRow` and `@updateEndRow` right before performing any change to the actual state in `@getState`. I didn't batch these methods because they are used also by other non-batched operations (see `@updateHighlightState`) and therefore need to be updated every time. On the other hand they are very fast, and it should be quite cheap to call them.

This should solve once for all any issue that arise from the presenter going out-of-sync with the underlying model because of the async nature of the updates. As a result, I believe that the original issue can be closed as well.

Once again, sorry if this has caused problems to you!

the approach is inserting resizable view (named pane-resize-handle-view) between two panes. when user move the resizable view,  I will change the pane's flexGrow style value by two pane's width or height ratio. for example, if the left pane is  200px and the right pane is 600px, then I will modify flexGrow style to 0.5 and 1.5.

A quick win was to simply iterate over the buffer range in reverse order: when destroying a fold, `DisplayBuffer#updateScreenLines` gets called unless the row is inside a larger fold; starting from the bottom helps reducing the amount of calls dramatically (moreover, this is how the rest of atom core handles folds traversal, so we win also in consistency :v:).

However, this was not enough to have acceptable performance because, for each row in the range, the buffer was traversed back and forth to find folds intersecting such rows. This is unnecessary, since we need only to perform such traversal on `start.row` and `end.row`, and simply destroy anything in between. This would catch any larger fold and the rest of them must be right inside `bufferRange` (outermost rows included). :racehorse: :racehorse: :racehorse: 

@nathansobo: I am wondering if we should remove [the previous optimization](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5843); after these changes we save a relatively short amount of time skipping `destroyFoldsIntersectingBufferRange` on `selectAll`.

-  d21ae2c modifies the click handlers for the gutter to select buffer lines, rather than screen lines. Clicking the gutter for any screen line of a wrapped buffer line selects the whole buffer line (previously, only the clicked screen line would have been selected).
- 03a064b adds more tests for checking how click handlers for the gutter behave when soft wrap is turned on (I duplicated all the existing tests, turned on soft wrap, and then tweaked them to test the new functionality).

When I add an atom directory provider with uri like: myuri://server:port/some_path and reload atom or close/open atom, the default directory provider normalizes my uri path (bc it calls path.normalize on it eve though it's not a local filesystem directory).
https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/default-directory-provider.coffee#L16-L24

How do you think about the following solution:
1- The deafult directory provider returns a directory only when it exists on the filesystem.
2- On deserializing and creating the project with paths, if a projectPath can't be handled by a directory provider, it's added to another array to be consumed later by atom packages, when they are loaded

That's trying to work-around the nature of atom core initializing before packages are loaded and able to provide their directory providers.

It introduces, in facts, the notion of batching along with some other performance improvements :racehorse: You can find some pieces of information about batching in the aforementioned issue, but I'll report some key ideas here as well.

We noticed that a lot of computation was wasted in `TextEditorPresenter`, especially when performing multi-operations (e.g. select many things, write on many lines, etc.). If we write a character on 10 lines simultaneously, the whole UI would be recomputed 10 times, even though this was an atomic operation.

Therefore we came up with the concept of batching: before making an atomic operation, we explicitly put `TextEditor` on `batchMode`. This will emit two events: one on start and one at the end. `TextEditorPresenter` intercepts them and records what changes would have happened during the batching timeframe (if the same change would have been applied many times, it just keeps the last one). When batching ends, it applies all the recorded operation.

When `transact`ing, batching happens automatically. 

If we agree this could be a suitable redesign and we manage to refine this a bit, it seems like we get rid of almost any bottleneck in the presentation layer. Writing 5 characters on 1000 lines simultaneously shows that most of the time is now spent on `TextBuffer` and `mergeIntersectingSelections` (we need to make this even faster):

In the case of Atom's text editor, it's worth the effort to avoid this overhead by hand coding all DOM updates. The update code is repetitive, but it's also pretty straightforward. In exchange, we get much simpler profile traces, drop a big dependency, and reduce the overall number of moving parts in Atom. Below are some flame graphs for entering a character at the end of a syntax-highlighted line. The comparison is somewhat unfair because the React case _could_ have been a bit more optimized, but I think the pictures also show how much simpler the manual approach is in our case.

It still needs a lot of refactoring (and some test cases too), but I just wanted to evaluate the approach that me and @nathansobo agreed on the aforementioned issue. To recap, the following is a brief explanation of how the solution works.

When lines with an indentation are soft wrapped, they are prepended with a phantom token which is as long as the indentation of the original line. This token is not selectable, nor reachable by the cursor. I had to change how `DisplayBuffer#clipScreenPosition` worked, since I could not treat the phantom token as an hard tab. I'd like to remark that this is still experimental code, but based on my tests I can confirm it works pretty well.

~~There's a subtle bug, though, which needs to be addressed and which I'll be looking at soon after creating this pull request. When a line is indented but no space is present, Atom freezes: I am quite sure this is due to how soft wrapping works on lines without spaces (namely, lines without words). I am quite sure this can be fixed easily, it just needs some more attention (and a better knowledge of the codebase).~~

I also verified that running the following printed out an `HgRepository`:

```
var Directory = require('pathwatcher').Directory;
atom.project.repositoryForDirectory(
    new Directory(atom.project.getPath(), /* symlink */ false)).then(
        function(repo) { console.log('repo: %o', repo); });
```

One thing that stands out to me about the current API for the
atom.repository-provider service is that the function used to create
a `RepositoryProvider` does not receive any arguments. If the creation
of the `GitRepositoryProvider` were done via the service, this would
be a problem because it needs a reference to `atom.project`, which is
not defined when it is created. (We work around this because it is
created in `Project`'s constructor, so it can pass `this` to
`new GitRepositoryProvider()`.)

We would have to create a `RepositoryProviderFactory` or something if
we wanted to specify arguments when creating a `RepositoryProvider`,
in general. Maybe that's too crazy / not an issue, in practice.

Though note that `GitRepository` cannot access `atom.project` lazily
because it uses it in its constructor to do the following:

```
if @project?
  @subscriptions.add @project.eachBuffer (buffer) => @subscribeToBuffer(buffer)
```

So long as we can guarantee that `atom.project` is defined before the
other providers are initialized, I think we should be OK.

Follow-up work:
- Replace the use of `RepositoryProvider.createRepositorySync()` with
  `RepositoryProvider.repositoryForDirectory()` in `Project.setPaths()`.
- Replace all uses of `Project.getRepositories()` with
  `Project.repositoryForDirectory()` in packages that are bundled with Atom
  by default.
- Implement `Directory.exists()` and/or `Directory.existsSync()` and update
  `git-repositor-provider.coffee`, as appropriate.
- Eliminate `GitRepositoryProvider.repositoryForDirectory()`'s use of
  synchronous methods.
- Somewhat orthogonal to this diff, but the following fields need to be
  removed from `Project` because they enforce the idea of a single root:
  `path`, `rootDirectory`, and `repo`. This has implications around the
  existing use of `@rootDirectory?.off()` and `@destroyRepo()`.

These are all things where 1 copy would suffice. And the module cache wasn't catching all of these dupes since certain dependencies weren't aligned causing extra requires at startup.

This PR aligns version dependencies on these modules and aggressively de-dupes them so that only 1 version is shipped with Atom.

apm uses `semver.validRange` to [determine if the semver of `engines.atom` is valid](https://github.com/atom/apm/blob/94d2dd96114cbbefc52ad728f5ec870d6d3ce4c6/src/install.coffee#L508), and if it isn't -- it skips that version of the package. Here's how that behaves for the recommended semver in the guide:

```
> semver.validRange("">=0.174.0, <2.0.0"")

null
```

Here's how it behaves with the change suggested in this PR:

```
> semver.validRange("">=0.174.0 <2.0.0"")

'>=0.174.0 <2.0.0'

Also, the range works as expected when testing whether a version is in that range:

```
> semver.satisfies(""0.178.0"", "">=0.174.0 <2.0.0"")
true
> semver.satisfies(""2.178.0"", "">=0.174.0 <2.0.0"")

![presenter diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/5943048/d3ef770a-a6d8-11e4-9ed7-aa4ce2a650f2.png)

The presenter manages a mutable state object that is synchronously updated whenever there are changes from the model or changes to measurements from the view. The view consumes this state object when updating the DOM asynchronously so we don't need to recompute it before every render like we do now.

This reconfiguration paves the way to perform all DOM updates manually rather than relying on React's virtual DOM reconciliation system. The view will maintain a copy of the presenter state, and it will perform a comparison of the presenter's state against the copy when updating the DOM.

The net result will be a design very similar to React's reconciliation mechanism, but my hope is that a lower-level implementation targeting our specific problem domain will make this design easier to profile and open up specific optimizations that wouldn't be possible at a higher level of abstraction. We already perform DOM updates to lines and line numbers manually to optimize around reconciliation overhead; this would just complete that process.
## Remaining work
### Optimizations
- [x] Perform a single decorations query when the visible row range changes to cache the visible decorations, then read decoration classes from that when building lines, line numbers, etc rather than querying multiple times on every change.
- [x] When decorations are added / removed, update only the decoration classes on lines and line numbers rather than doing a full pass on their content.
- [x] Cache `foldable` status for each line in the tokenized buffer instead of recomputing it every time we update the line numbers.
### Fixes
- [x] Fix velocity scrolling upward
- [x] Fix TextEditorComponent specs
- [x] Compute row id correctly when the first visible line is soft-wrapped.
- [x] Eliminate `TextEditorPresenter::getHeight`
- [x] Audit handling of scrollTop/scrollLeft
- [x] Enforce maximum scrollTop/Left based on height/width and content. This should hopefully address some flakiness in the random test.

I had a couple options
1. Just run the value through the correct schema on `get`. This is not intrusive, but it slows down reads. And reads happen a lot
2. Split up initial config load to loading core config, loading package schemas, then loading the rest of the config values
3. Reset the all values in the user config on schema changes to take advantage of the new schemas

I opted for option 3 as it should keep the config in sync as packages are activated/deactivated/installed, etc. This may have an impact on startup time because the user config is reset (though, without save) for each schema addition.

The main upside here is that `cson-safe` doesn't eval the files but instead parses them safely just like `JSON.parse` does.

This will break any `.cson` files that contain code since they will no longer parse correctly.  This is a good thing since the expectations of CSON are the same as JSON, they parse to plain old JavaScript objects with arrays, string, numbers, and booleans.

This PR also upgrades to CoffeeScript 1.8 across the board for `.cson` files and `.coffee` files.

#### Problem

Currently, each scoped settings file or snippets file that is loaded from a package causes expensive events to be emitted on `atom.config`. Emitting these events is expensive because:
- The act of adding scoped settings clears the scoped settings cache
- Callbacks registered via `atom.config::onDidChange` or `::observe` receive the new property value as an argument. Computing the new value requires re-merging the scoped properties with an _empty cache_.

Merging scoped properties recently became more expensive due to deep-merging.
#### Solution

This adds a new method to `Config` called `::transact` which allow multiple config changes to be 'rolled up', firing only one change event.

Currently, I only use `::transact` in `PackageManager` when activating and deactivating packages. I think the snippets package should also use it when loading snippets files from packages.

### Steps
- [x] Make `Config::get` and `::set` take trailing options hashes
- [x] Add a `source` option to `Config::set`
- [x] Use the user's settings file path as the default source in `::set`
- [x] Add `sources` and `excludeSources` options to `Config::get`
- [x] Fix remaining failing specs related to the user config using new source information
- [x] Add `Config::unset`
- [x] Make `Config::observe` and `::onDidChange` consistent with `::get` by taking a scope as an option instead of the first argument.
- [x] Throw exception when trying to specify a `source` without a scope selector (To be fixed by #4567).
- [x] Bugfix: only use special priority for settings w/ user's config file as source
- [x] Update docs
- [x]  Deprecate `::isDefault` and `::getDefault` in favor of using the `source` option to `::get`
- [ ] Add a way to get settings set from with a source _directory_ (needed by [this code](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/blob/master/lib/package-snippets-view.coffee#L26) in settings-view)

By default overlays are positioned at the head of the given marker. This option allows them to be positioned at the tail instead by passing `position: ‚Äôtail‚Äô` when creating the decoration, which is useful for autocomplete.

I tried various other approaches for positioning the overlay in autocomplete without adding this option, but the complexity of the text manipulation (due to the fact that the case of the prefix and suffix can be altered) meant that any other markers I created were always getting moved to undesirable places. Since we restore the selections following the text manipulation, simply positioning the overlay at the tail is the most convenient and simple approach.

It needs to be easy to style text editors in a way that diverges from the current syntax theme when desired. Without the shadow DOM, this was simply a matter of overriding styles on the editor. With the shadow DOM, this has become harder, leading to problems like the following in the settings view:

![Settings view mini editors](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1789/5020293/f3746d96-6a84-11e4-8ae4-473e98354f2c.png)

Ultimately, there's no avoiding the reality of the shadow DOM when overriding text editor styling, but it should be as clean and simple as possible. This PR makes some changes to ensure any text editor can be styled as follows:

``` less
atom-text-editor {
  background-color: white;
  color: black
}

atom-text-editor::shadow .cursor {
  border-color: white;
}
```

In order to make this happen, syntax themes need to style the host element itself rather than a nested root node. This will allow external styles to easily override them. To encourage this change, I have removed the `.editor` class from the element at the root of the shadow DOM, replacing it with a `.editor--private` class to discourage any future use. Syntax theme authors now need to set the background color of the editor via the `:host` pseudo-selector, as follows:

``` less
:host {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
```

They will also need to avoid scoping any other styles by the `.editor` selector. A simple approach that also supports the shadow DOM being disabled is to scope nested selectors under both `.editor` and `:host`:

``` less
// This should be replaced...
.editor, :host {
  .cursor { }
  // more styles
}
```

I plan to open PRs on the top 30 syntax themes to make these small changes.

This should further reduce the count to `Module._findPath` for all the packages installed to `~/.atom/packages`.

These extensions will be added on the next `apm install` and `apm upgrade` for packages already installed, and can also be regenerated by running `apm rebuild-module-cache`.

Defaults are strange with scoped properties because scoped properties are additive. You can set `some.setting` 10 times with similar scopes creating a chain of properties that need to be evaluated against a scoped descriptor. Which one of those set is the default? The path through those scoped properties depends on ordering and specificity when matched against a scopeDescriptor.

Defaults here rely on some simplifications based on our use of scoped settings.
1. Every value set in the property store has a `source` property indicating where it came from. Each scoped setting set via the user config file or `Config::set`, has this `source` property set to `user-config`. Scoped defaults can be any scoped property who's `source` property is not `user-config`. So anything set by a package's `scoped-properties.cson` is a default, and anything the user sets is an override.
2. The settings view needs to check and reset the default values with the same scope selector used to initially set the properties. Currently these selectors are language scopes: `'.source.js'`, etc. eg. The way it's written in this PR, we cannot reset the default for the scope descriptor `['.source.js', '.meta.function.name']`, but we can for `['.source.js']` because `'.source.js'` is the way it went in.

For reason number 2, all the methods; `isDefault`, `getDefault`, `restoreDefault`, `getSettings`; take a `scopeSelector`, not a `scopeDescriptor`.

Previously our style sheets were managed globally, but with the introduction of the shadow DOM we now need to be able to load stylesheets into specific contexts and not others. The theme manager was previously mutating the DOM directly when stylesheets were applied, which clashed with our requirement of loading specific stylesheets in specific contexts. This PR now introduces a new custom element `<atom-styles>`, which interacts with the style manager at `atom.styles` to render the stylesheets in our head.

The next step will introduce targeting stylesheets to specific contexts. When an `<atom-styles>` element is appended to a shadow root, it will only add child style elements that are targeted for that shadow root. If stylesheets are targeted with a specific context, they won't be loaded in the document's head.

Currently, the new style manager only focuses on _applying_ stylesheets. Loading is still handled in the theme manager. It should probably be moved so the theme manager only deals with themes, not stylesheet loading and compilation.

Thank you for developing and maintaining Atom!

I'm using it on GNU/Linux Ubuntu and it seems the launcher (`.desktop` file) has a capital letter in its name. It should be renamed to `atom.desktop` because a `.desktop` file should not contain capital letters as any other `.desktop` files that we can find in `/usr/share/applications`.

Note that we also have another problem because currently, the window's class of all Atom windows is `Atom Shell` but the launcher is named `Atom`. We should also add this line in your `.desktop` file:

```
StartupWMClass=Atom Shell
```

Because without that, it's not possible for a dock/panel (like Cairo-Dock) to link a launcher (`Atom`) with its window (`Atom Shell`).

But it's certainly better to rename the window's class and this is why I just created this pull request in the `atom-shell` project! => https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/pull/698

3761,89,28,5,Internals,kevinsawicki,2014-10-15T21:00:10Z,462,12,11,7,"## The Problem

Atom packages installed to `~/.atom/packages` do not share any requires with core or the packages bundled with Atom.

For example, imagine a package has a dependency on [underscore](http://underscorejs.org) 1.7.

When that package does a `require('underscore')`, underscore will be required and loaded out of the packages `node_modules` folder even if Atom core has this same dependency and has already required underscore@1.7.0. Two copies of the exact same module are required and loaded instead of them sharing that exact same dependency.

So if underscore 1.7 takes 10 milliseconds to require and 10 packages you've installed are using it, Atom will spend 100 milliseconds at startup requiring 10 identical copies, instead of requiring it once and sharing that copy among the 10 packages.

This has led package authors to do the following performance hacks:

``` js
require(path.join(atom.getLoadSettings().resourcePath, 'node_modules', 'underscore'))
```

This requires it directly out of core and so it will only loaded once since the full path is given to `require`.

This hack has the downside of packages breaking when Atom core upgrades or removes dependencies.
## The Solution

Patch node's [Module](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/25702abc5638bbecffa92e8349d2a871a5f592c9/lib/module.js#L321) to allow packages to share modules.

So if a package is dependent on underscore `>= 1.5` and underscore `1.7` has already been loaded by core or another package, that already required underscore version will be used instead of loading a new copy out of the package's `node_modules` folder.

This is accomplished by doing the following:
- Precompute all the dependencies a package ships with when it is installed so Atom can track which version of modules are available across all packages and core.
- Precompute what modules each folder in a package depends on. That way when any file is required in that folder, Atom can immediately know what module versions it needs and return a version from the cache if a compatible version has already been required.

So by patching `Module._resolveFilename`, Atom can find a compatible version of a module already loaded without stat-ing or reading any files on disk.

It instead uses the precomputed dependency graph to be able to immediately resolve a module name and version to the path of a compatible version that has already been required.

Packages won't have to do anything to take advantage of this, it will be automatically detected during `apm install` and handled transparently.

Packages will still always get a version of the module that satisfies the dependency range listed in their `package.json` file.

The apm changes are in https://github.com/atom/apm/pull/200
## The Results

To verify that this approach improved startup time I decided to measure the load and activate time for several packages.  These packages were chosen because they are all dependent on at least one module and they have similar dependencies to the modules bundled with Atom and/or each other.

Building on https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3674, the plan is to allow for scoped configuration of editor settings. This solves the problem of ""I only want to soft wrap in markdown documents"", ""I need hard tabs for make"", ""I want 2 space tabs for ruby and 4 space tabs for python"", etc. 
### The settings

Here are the settings I plan on scoping:

``` coffee
# Scoping these is obvious to me
editor.softTabs
editor.tabLength
editor.softWrap
editor.softWrapAtPreferredLineLength
editor.showInvisibles
editor.showIndentGuide
editor.nonWordCharacters

# Scoping these seems good, but maybe not
editor.invisibles
editor.autoIndent
editor.normalizeIndentOnPaste
```

Language packages will be able to set these settings in their `scoped-properties` cson files. 

Comment if you have suggestions about settings that should / should not be scoped. 
### User config file format

The user will also be able to override these settings in their config file. The plan right now is to place all the current settings under a `global` key, then any overridden scoped settings under their scope. Check it:

``` coffee
'global':
  'editor':
    'fontSize': 14
    'fontFamily': 'monaco'
    'tabLength': 4
  'core':
    'themes': [
      'atom-light-ui'
      'atom-light-syntax'
    ]
'.source.gfm':
  'softWrap': true
'.source.gfm .code':
  'softWrap': false
'.source.ruby':
  'tabLength': 2
```

In this example, all languages other than ruby will use 4 space tabs, and ruby will use 2. Additionally, markdown files will be wrapped. One neat thing, because of scoping, is that code blocks in markdown will _not_ be wrapped in this case. 
### Backward compatibility

The config file will be read in as it is today. It will check for a `global` key, and if not there assume the old format. Upon writing the file back out, it will write out with global config under the `global` key.

I initially set out to return `Disposable` instances from `atom.contextMenu.add`, but then I noticed that the format for expressing items didn't match up with `atom.menu.add`. This PR corrects that. You can now add context menus with the same format as adding application menus, with selectors mapping to arrays containing menu items as follows:

``` coffee
atom.contextMenu.add '.editor': [
  {label: 'Undo', command: 'core:undo'}
  {label: 'Redo', command: 'core:redo'}
  {label: 'Other', submenu: [
    {label: 'Transpose', command: 'editor:transpose'}
    ]
  }
]
```
## Created and Should Display Hooks

There's also a new `shouldDisplay` hook to address a use case I saw in color-picker, which is currently digging into `ContextMenuManager` internals to conditionally display a menu item. This is a sketch of how the API could be used, but not real code from the actual color-picker.

``` coffee
atom.contextMenu.add '.editor': [{
  label: 'Pick Color',
  command: 'color-picker:',
  shouldDisplay: (event) -> # use the right click event to decide...
}]
```

The `executeAtBuild` hook has been replaced with `created`. I couldn't find anyone using this other than us because it wasn't exposed in our API, so I went ahead and just renamed it without shimming. Here's the `created` hook being used to add the `x` and `y` of the click event to the command.

``` coffee
atom.contextMenu.add '.workspace': [{
  label: 'Inspect Element'
  command: 'application:inspect'
  devMode: true
  created: (event) ->
    {pageX, pageY} = event
    @commandOptions = {x: pageX, y: pageY}
}]
```
## Dev Mode

Dev-mode-only items were formerly expressed with a trailing options hash on the entire call to `::add`. Now each individual item can contain a `devMode` field indicating whether it should only display in dev mode. You can see this in the `Inspect Element` example above.
## Disposables

Finally, `::add` now returns a disposable on which `::dispose` can be called to remove the added item descriptors.
## Outreach

We should probably talk to the author of color-picker and any other packages that dig into context menu internals to get them to switch to the new API. We may even want to send them a PR before merging this if the number is manageable.

- [x] Fix failing specs due to jQuery `trigger` being called for commands instead of native event dispatch.
## Description

This PR properly integrates the new global command registry (`atom.commands`) with package activation events. It does the following:
- Switches the syntax of `atom.activationEvents` to `atom.activationCommands`. This hash has mandatory selectors mapping to strings or arrays of strings as follows:

``` coffee
  activationCommands: {
    "".workspace"": [
      ""project-find:show"",
      ""project-find:toggle"",
      ""project-find:show-in-current-directory"",
      # ...
    ]
  }
```
- Uses `atom.commands` instead of `$::command` to listen for package activation. This means we won't need to use a deprecated API to support this behavior when we deprecate `atom.workspaceView` and `$::command`.
- Ensures that commands registered with `atom.commands` are invoked only once even when the activation command is replayed after activating the package.

This is delicate work but I'm pretty sure it preserves existing behavior. Specs pass and I tried a handful of baked-in packages without issues. The last remaining issue is to deal with specs that call `trigger` to invoke commands, which isn't picked up by our native handlers. I'd like to find a way to enhance jQuery's `trigger` to invoke real DOM events. One nice thing: Because the command registry uses the [capture phase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener) of events, we don't need to disable the jQuery event listeners anymore to prevent them from being invoked twice. We stop propagation of the activation command and reinvoke it after activating the package. It's this second invocation that ends up calling listeners registered via jQuery.

This PR is another step in move away from SpacePen and towards HTML 5 custom elements. It adds two methods to `Workspace`:
## ::getView(object)

This method can be called with any object in the workspace in order to get a view. You can use it to get the view corresponding to the workspace itself, panes, or pane items.  It _always_ returns a DOM node rather than a SpacePen view. In the near future, it will return HTML 5 custom elements for all our views in core, but for now it just returns the root DOM node of SpacePen views with a `__spacePenView` expando property pointing back at the view. A branch is already in progress to convert core views to custom elements.

``` coffee
editorView = atom.workspace.getView(atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor())
paneView = atom.workspace.getView(atom.workspace.getActivePane())

# this one is weird but worth it for consistency. getting the workspace view
# should be rare once the panel APIs are in place.
workspaceView = atom.workspace.getView(atom.workspace)
```
## ::addViewProvider

This is the other half of `::getView`. If you add a model object as a pane or panel item, the workspace's view needs to know how to present it on screen. This is how you teach workspace to do that:

``` coffee
atom.workspace.addViewProvider
  modelConstructor: TextEditor # Future name of Editor
  viewConstructor: TextEditorElement # Future custom element for TextEditor
```

Custom elements are required to have a `::setModel` method so the model can be assigned since element constructors don't take arguments.

You can also provide a `createView` factory method which is passed the model. This mechanism provides more flexibility but is less convenient if all you want to is build a custom element.
## Next Steps

Next up: converting our core views to custom elements, which includes workspace views and text editors. Every model object in the workspace should have its view constructed via the new provider API. After that, we'll be in position to switch to custom tag names and explore using the shadow DOM.

## Tasks
- [x] Command dispatching
- [x] Assign `atom.commands` global
- [x] Test out some basic commands
- [x] List commands registered via `atom.commands` and `$::command` in the
    command palette
- [x] Document `atom.commands`
- We should wait to deprecate `$::command` until our overall view strategy is
  in place.
## Background

Currently, to register a command in Atom you are forced to use jQuery. When you call `::command` on a jQuery-wrapped DOM node, it registers a custom event listener based on the command name with `::on` and adds some metadata to the element with `::data`, which we read out later to display a list of available commands for the focused element in the command palette.

This approach has a couple major issues. First, it forces users to use our jQuery extension to register any command. Second, it forces users to get references to view instances when they could otherwise get by operating entirely on the model. If we're going to move away from requiring jQuery to build packages, we need a new approach for registering commands.
## Basics

Commands will be registered via a new global, `atom.commands`, and all events will be handled via _event delegation_ rather than listening directly on specific view instances. Here's a basic example where we listen for increase/decrease font size commands on the workspace.

``` coffee
disposable = atom.commands.add '.workspace',
  'window:increase-font-size': -> @getModel().increaseFontSize()
  'window:decrease-font-size': -> @getModel().decreaseFontSize()

# to remove these commands later...
disposable.dispose()
```

First comes the `.workspace` CSS selector, indicating we want to handle these commands when they bubble through the workspace element. Then comes a hash mapping command names to handlers. Each handler is invoked in the context of the DOM element that matches the selector.

Eventually these will be HTML 5 custom elements with domain-specific methods, but for now we extend the element with a `::getModel()` method so the workspace model can be accessed from the view. Jumping straight to the model will probably be the most common pattern, since we don't want to perform logic in the view.

To remove the added commands, just call `.dispose()` on the disposable that's returned from add.
## Bubbling Semantics

Command events begin at the event target and bubble upward. As the event bubbles through each node, event listeners associated with matching selectors are called in order of specificity. In the event of a specificity tie, the most recently added listeners are called first, just like in CSS. To cancel bubbling, call `.stopPropagation()` on the event as normal. You can also call `.stopImmediatePropagation()` to stop bubbling and also stop invoking additional listeners on the current element.
## Command Palette (In Progress)

The command registry has a `::findCommands` method, named to blend in with `::findKeyBindings` on the `KeymapManager`. You call it with an element to get a list of all commands that can be dispatched on that element.

``` coffee
atom.commands.findCommands(element: document.activeElement)
### =>
[
  {
    name: 'window:increase-font-size'
    displayName: 'Workspace: Increase Font Size'
    selector: '.workspace'
  },
  {
    name: 'window:decrease-font-size'
    displayName: 'Workspace: Decrease Font Size'
    selector: '.workspace'
  }
  ...
]
###
```
## Backward Compatibility

The command registry can peacefully coexist with commands registered via our `$::command` method so long as `::findCommands` includes commands registered via jQuery in addition to those registered via the new model. We'll deprecate `$::command` and eventually remove it.
## Event Handling Strategy

The command registry currently listen for events with _capture semantics_, meaning it gets the first crack at all custom events. I'm not sure this is the best approach because it could interfere with listeners that are registered directly on elements, but on the other hand, this is sort of the point. It seemed like it might be a good idea so we can guarantee that people can always invoke commands they see in the command palette. With this approach, the command registry is always the source of truth.
## Future Possibilities

One issue we encounter is that people want to refer to a command in multiple ways when typing in the command palette. This is discussed in atom/command-palette#11. We could allow richer metadata to be provided instead of just a callback as follows.

``` coffee
atom.commands.add '.workspace',
  'window:increase-font-size':
    listener: -> @getModel().increaseFontSize()
    displayName: ""Window: Make Fonts Bigger""
    aliases: [""window:embiggen-fonts"", ""window:i-cant-read-that!""]
```

Just an idea. Don't want to do it in this PR.

This is the time between when atom-shell require's Atom's [main](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/d8be03850bb39f2b8472261fb47c610bbdfb509c/src/browser/main.coffee#L1) file and the [first window is created](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/d8be03850bb39f2b8472261fb47c610bbdfb509c/src/browser/main.coffee#L51).

This includes the time taken to parse the command line arguments, create the native windows, setup the crash reporter, setup the system menus, and start the auto updater.

This does not include the time take to reopen editors, show the tree view, or anything that happens inside the opened window, just everything between app launch and when the window is created.

I added a new benchmark that starts the app 10 times and averages the app startup time.
### Before

```
Startup Runs: 10
First run time: 180ms
Max time: 196ms
Min time: 173ms
Average time: 181ms
```
### After

```
Startup Runs: 10
First run time: 138ms
Max time: 138ms
Min time: 117ms
Average time: 121ms
```

This is on a Macbook Pro on OS X 10.8.5 with 2.6 Ghz Intel Core i7 processors and 16 GB of memory.

Note that doing a `new BrowserWindow()` which creates the native window takes roughly `40ms` on my machine so that would be the absolute minimum that we would get these times down to.
### Running the benchmark

I'd be curious what results other people see so if you want to post your before and after results do the following:
#### On Mac OS X
- Pull down this branch
- Do a `git checkout d7106a6b4` to checkout the commit before the changes were made
- Run `script/build`
- Run `benchmark/browser-process-startup.coffee` to see the _before_ results
- Do a `git checkout ks-lower-browser-process-startup-time` to checkout the latest commit
- Run `script/build` again
- Run `benchmark/browser-process-startup.coffee` to see the _after_ results
#### On Linux/Windows
- Pull down this branch
- Do a `git checkout fbeb9ec` to checkout the commit before the changes were made
- Run `script/build`
- Run `atom -f .` and look for an output line in the terminal that starts with `App load time:`
- Quit Atom
- Do a `git checkout ks-lower-browser-process-startup-time` to checkout the latest commit
- Run `script/build` again
- Run `atom -f .` again and look for an output line in the terminal that starts with `App load time:`

The two times will be the _before_ and _after_ results.
### What changed

Much of the time spent on my machine was doing `require`s of lots of files that weren't used until later on or possible never at all, but the requires were at the top of the files and so the first window wasn't being shown until all these requires were complete.

Many of these were moved to be required right before use in response to an event or request from a render process.

But in the interest of getting to the API freeze faster, I think we should avoid pulling a complex framework into core at this time. This PR focuses on simplifying and clarifying the events API without introducing observables, but the proposed changes are compatible with adding RxJS observables in the future.

The goal of this PR is to reform all the event APIs to use methods instead of strings for all the objects involved in everything in workspace.
## Tasks
- [x] Add New APIs
  - [x] Workspace
    - [x] Pane
    - [x] PaneAxis
    - [x] PaneContainer
- [x] Document New APIs
- [x] Deprecate Old APIs
  - [x] Deprecate theorist-dependent code paths
  - [x] Deprecate direct calls to `::on`
  - [x] Deprecate supplanted methods
## API Conventions
- All event subscriptions should occur through explicit methods rather than through strings passed to `::on`.
- Event subscription methods take callbacks as their final argument. In the future, we can add the ability to return an observable when no callback is provided.
- Event subscription methods return _disposables_. When you call `.dispose()` on the returned disposable the subscription is cancelled.
- Event callbacks are always invoked with a single object. If multiple pieces of information need to be passed, the object can be a hash with named entries.
- Event subscription methods conform to the following naming conventions:
  - Discrete events are named with `onDid[Verb][Noun]` or `onWill[Verb][Noun]`:
    - `onDidActivate`
    - `onDidAddItem`
    - `onWillDestroyItem`
  - Properties that change can have two kinds of methods:
    - Methods that invoke the callback the next time the property _changes_ take the form `onDidChange[PropertyName]`:
      - `onDidChangeActiveItem`
    - Methods that invoke the callback immediately with the current value and also whenever it changes take the form `observe[PropertyName]`:
      - `observeActiveItem`
  - Collections can be observed with `observe[CollectionName]`, which will invoke the callback with all current and future elements:
    - `observePanes`
## Usage Guidelines

I've created a simple npm called [event-kit](https://github.com/atom/event-kit). The goal is to provide a few building blocks for implementing and consuming evented APIs while maintaining maximal simplicity.
### Implementing Evented APIs

We want to move away from mixins and toward composition. Toward that end, `event-kit` exports a simple `Emitter` object that can be used to streamline evented APIs. Rather than mixing it in, you construct an `Emitter` instance and use it internally. Here's a sample of how you use it:

``` coffee
{Emitter} = require 'event-kit'

class Pane
  constructor: ->
    # implementation...
    @emitter = new Emitter

  onDidChangeActiveItem: (fn) ->
    @emitter.on 'did-change-active-item', fn

  setActiveItem: (activeItem) ->
    unless activeItem is @activeItem
      @activeItem = activeItem
      @emitter.emit 'did-change-active-item', activeItem
    @activeItem
```

This is similar to the existing emitter from emissary, but it's maximally simple and omits several features such as namespaces and support for multiple event arguments. The `::on` method also returns `Disposable` instances which unsubscribe when `.dispose()` is called on them.

Using emitters via _instances_ instead of mixins ensures users won't call `::on` directly and gives us leverage for deprecating existing direct usages of `::on`.

If needed, `Disposable` can be used directly. You build a disposable with a function that is called when the disposable is disposed. This intentionally follows the same API as RxJS.

``` coffee
{Disposable} = require 'event-kit'

disposable = new Disposable(=> @cleanUp())
```
### Consuming Evented APIs

We want to encourage users to dispose of subscriptions when they are done with them, and we now think the best way to do this is to make it _explicit_. So now rather than using the `Subscriber` mixin, we will encourage users to build their own `CompositeDisposable` instance and add subscriptions to it.

``` coffee
{CompositeDisposable} = require 'event-kit'

class TabBar
  constructor: (@pane) ->
    @subscriptions = new CompositeDisposable
    @subscriptions.add @pane.observeActiveItem -> # ...
    @subscriptions.add @pane.onDidAddItem -> # ...
    @subscriptions.add @pane.onDidRemoveItem -> # ...

  destroyed: ->
    @subscriptions.dispose()
```

Users will need to remember to dispose of the subscriptions, but we think that making it more explicit will help clarify what is going on in examples and increase the likelihood that package authors clean up.

It updates fine if the above keybind is in the user's keymap.cson, but it doesn't update if it's in linux.cson. (done after rebuild/reinstall) 

**Unrelated to pull request**:

Suggestion: `ctrl-alt-o` should be binded to `application:open-folder`. It's useful and many people will benefit from having this by default.

Discussion: however, _ctrl-alt_ doesn't make the most sense, _ctrl-shift_ does. As we (kind of) want to open multiple files (implicitly a folder) and that's usually what _shift_ key is related to. However, `'ctrl-shift-o': 'application:open-dev'` and `'ctrl-shift-i': 'window:toggle-dev-tools'` exist already. 

If we really want to use `ctrl-shift-o` as open folder, it wouldn't make the most sense to have `ctrl-shift-i` as dev tools. We must change both _open-dev_ and _toggle-dev-tools_ to be combined with _alt_ instead of _shift_. What do you think of this?

Instead of opening file paths in a new window based on the file's parent directory, open file paths in the current window.

Also open folders in the current window when the current window doesn't already have a project path. This will affect untitled windows that were launched from the dock or by pressing `cmd-shift-N`.

You can still always force a new window from the command line by running `atom -n package.json` or `atom --new-window package.json`.

Multi-folder project support is still planned though via #770.

- Simplify scrollbar refresh and measurement by using imperative DOM
  manipulation instead of React to hide/show scrollbars.
- Rename `::performInitialMeasurement` to `::becameVisible`
- Break `::checkForVisibilityChange` out of `::pollDOM` and use it in
  to check for the element becoming visible in `componentWillUpdate`.
- Don't rely on stored visibility state anywhere. Always check again.
  This could potentially be cached for an update cycle but being wrong
  about this is disastrous so I'm being conservative.

Previously, editors always assigned their font styles inline based on the config settings. We then had some mini-editor-specific styles for the line height and opted out of setting the line height inline for mini editors only. This was kind of a confusing mess.

This PR updates the editors to behave just like ordinary HTML elements, using whatever the computed font styles are on the root editor element as the basis of our rendering decisions. The setting of the font size, font family, and line height is now moved to a global stylesheet that is managed by the workspace view. This will allow us to style mini editors (or any other editor for that matter) in a manner specific to its context with normal CSS.

This sets us up for the last step before switching to React-based mini editors, which is @benogle fixing the styling in key locations where mini editors are used.

`DisplayBuffer::getEditorWidthInChars()` is not taking into account the width of the scrollbar when the editor can vertically scroll.

This fix takes the scrollbar width into account all the time, even when it cannot scroll vertically. 

It might be cool to take the scrollbar into account only when the scrollbar is visible. But there are a couple problems:
- UX: when it switches from able to scroll to not able to scroll, it would reset the column, and reflow some lines. 
- It's a chicken and egg problem. Basically, to figure out if we need the scrollbar, we need to know all the screenlines, and to build the screenlines we need to know the softwrap column. But to figure out the softwrap column, we need to know if we show the scrollbar.

Here's what happens on resize of the editor in softwrap:

![screen shot 2014-07-10 at 3 29 37 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69169/3546309/b89fa66e-0881-11e4-93c7-310c8c499314.png)

`UpdateAllScreenLines` [deletes all the old screen lines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/display-buffer.coffee#L94) then [figures out the softwrap column](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/display-buffer.coffee#L366), so it cannot know whether or not there should be a vert scrollbar. 

Here are the ways I can think to get the proper column:
- We keep the old screenlines around, and determine scrollability based on those. Though there might be cases where it does the wrong thing because the screen lines changed drastically (say a huge resize).
- We compute the screen lines twice. Once with the scrollbar, if it isnt scrollable, then compute again without the scrollbar.
- Just account for the scrollbar all the time (as this pull does)

I'd prefer to merge this pull. Curious about your thoughts

Previously, we were storing an `active` boolean for each pane. We've had some strange bugs where every pane is serializing `active: false`, which causes exceptions when loading up the stored data.

This new approach serializes the activePaneId on the PaneContainer itself. Since the PaneContainer is the source of truth regarding the active pane, it makes more sense to handle it here.

This unfortunately changes the serialization version for the PaneContainer, so people won't have their pane state persisted after upgrading. But it seems better than leaving cruft to handle the old serialization situation.

This commit changes our autoscroll strategy for cursors significantly.

Originally, we were autoscrolling whenever the cursor's marker changed
positions. This worked well, except we didn't end up autoscrolling when
the user _attempted_ to move the cursor to an invalid position, such as
moving down at the end of the buffer, due to the fact that the marker
wouldn't change.

Then, we moved to always requesting an autoscroll whenever a position
change was requested via Cursor::changePosition. This missed out on
moving the cursor when inserting text, so we then also added an explicit
autoscroll call when inserting text.

This had the problem of not autoscrolling due to undo. So finally, this
solution combines explicit autoscroll in ::changePosition to capture
intent, as well as implicit autoscrolling whenever the cursor's marker
position changes due to a textual change in the buffer. This captures
undo/redo correctly.

The API is designed to be consistent with the marker API. The marker API has a `markBufferRange` function that returns a `Marker` object. Removal of the marker is done through a `destroy` method. The Decorations API takes on the same form:
- `(Decoration) decorateMarker(marker, decorationParams)`

These remain unchanged:
- `(Decoration) decorationForId(decorationId)`
- `(Object) decorationsForScreenRowRange(startScreenRow, endScreenRow)`
### Decoration

New:
- `(void) destroy()` - this just calls `displayBuffer::removeDecoration(this)`
- `(void) update(newParams)` - update the params with newParams. Lets the `displayBuffer` know there was an update, which will notify the `EditorComponent`.

Unchanged:
- `flash`

I previously thought that using `setImmediate` instead of `nextTick` fixed our jitter issues when requesting updates from animation frames, but it seems I was wrong. This PR returns to a strategy of updating synchronously in animation frames, so we never mix calls to `requestAnimationFrame` with `setImmediate`.

This PR also fixes an issue where we would handle stale `scroll` events emitted by the scrollbar elements while we were in the middle of updates, which was another source of jitter. Now we no longer get this kind of unintentional feedback when setting the scroll position in the model.

This PR updates the decorations on lines and line numbers in the following way:
- When the cursor is on a certain line, its line and line number will have the `.cursor-line` class.
- When a selection spans lines, their line and line numbers will have the `.selection-line` class.
- If the selection is empty, the cursor's line will _also_ contain the `.cursor-line-no-selection` class. I'd prefer this to be synthesized with `.cursor-line:not(.selection-line)` but we need it for backward compatibility.

Previously, the `.cursor-line` class would be applied to every line number in a selection, but now it's only applied to the line containing the cursor for consistency with what we do on line elements. This means certain themes will need to switch `.line-number.cursor-line` to `.line-number.selection-line` for the same effect. To support these themes in the old editor, we now also add `.selection-line` to the line numbers in the gutter.

Here you can see the line highlight working again in the light theme.

Previously, we were passing the screen ranges of highlights and cursors into their components, then using editor to convert these ranges to pixel positions. This worked for the most part, but when the cursor blinked it could sometimes get out of sync with changes to the model, meaning we asked for a pixel position for a screen position that didn't exist.

This PR changes things to precompute the raw pixel positions for cursors and highlights in the root component and pass it down. When the cursor blinks, we don't need to recompute a pixel position because it's a property that is passed in from the outside and doesn't change in this case.

This creates the issue in #2679, but also makes the editor feel dumpy on load as there is a sizable chunk of time where files are not colorized. 

So this preloads / sync loads the grammars needed by deserialized buffers. 

I just serialize the grammar name, and on deserialize, the `TokenizedBuffer` calls `atom.syntax.requestGrammarPreload`, which emits an event, which the relevant package handles and loads its grammars sync. This whole process happens _right_ before the soon-to-be-new TokenizedBuffer chooses its grammar. 

The biggest issue is that nowhere do we map grammar names to the name of the package, so I have a shitty hardcoded line in there to do this work until I have a legit solution. Options for solving this issue:
1. on serialize, serialize the name of the package, rather than the grammar name
2. add a package.json field specifying the grammar names that the package provides. Since grammars are not activated right away, I have no other way to read the name of the grammar. 

I'm leaning toward 1 because it will be hard to get people to change their package.json's and people will forget to add this field anyway.

### Changes

Some things changed from the previous iteration of decorations
- All decorations are marker based. It made storage and rendering easier. There are 2 functions on editor that you need to be concerned with: `addDecorationForMarker` and `removeDecorationForMarker`
- There are no more typeless decorations. You can apply to multiple decoration types by using an array: `{type: ['gutter', 'line'], class: 'sweet-view'}`
- Rather than an option to handle softWrapped lines in gutter / line types, you specify a range of `[[4, 0], [4, Infinity]]` to apply it to the wrapped rows, and `[[4, 0], [4, 0]]` to only apply to the initial row.

This commit also changes input handling to be more like it was in the previous editor. We're using textInput rather than input events because they are emitted _before_ characters are inserted, enabling much simpler detection of characters inserted via the accented-character menu on OS X.

We're also handling these events on the editor instead of the input component, which allows events to bubble from autocomplete-plus's hidden input element.

Previously I avoided this because something about it was causing reflows in the old editor, but in this editor that doesn't seem to be a problem, and it's actually faster.

When outdenting, the `leadingTabRegex` currently matches spaces only at the beginning of the line, while tabs are matched anywhere in the line. As a result, the outdent method would eat up legit characters on lines which contain tabs after the beginning of the line.

This change tweaks the regex so that tabs are matched only at the beginning of the line.

And this can cause problems, see Issue #2487

A better way is to use `rmdir /S /Q` as it takes care of the folder itself and it's contents.
/S - removes all directories and files in the specified directory in addition to the directory itself. (removes the directory tree)
/Q - obvious this is quite mode

I tested this approach on a couple machines that needed a clean before building and works OK with `rmdir`. It might give a warning in the console like `The system cannot find the file specified.` because not all of them are there but it can be ignored as the script will finish running.

TL;DR it is fixed but I don't know what was causing it.

Atom handles text input using a hidden input field. I suspected that the problem was this hidden input field was losing focus, so I added `setInterval((-> console.log document.activeElement), 1000)` to my `~/.atom/init.coffee` file. This logs if the hidden input loses focus. After double clicking around awhile the hidden input would lose focus and the body element would become focused.

I noticed the mouseDown event was being caught in an unknown parent of EditorComponent and would focus the body element. When the dev tools are used to look at what is bound to the mouseDown event you can see a react component is bound (expected) and a jquery object (unexpected):

![editor-component coffee - _users_corey_github_atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/596/3195476/3429481c-ed11-11e3-8a6a-0f7ac5467b94.jpg)

I solved this by making sure the mouseDown event in EditorComponent doesn't bubble. But I still wanted to know what event handler was causing this problem. I searched in Atom Core for mousedown handlers but none of those caused the problem. This led me to believe the problem was in a package, so I ran Atom in safe mode (`atom --safe`), which will start Atom with out any downloaded packages. In safe mode I could still recreate the problem. But the jquery mousedown event was no longer in the dev tools event viewer. I found out it was the color-viewer package that was adding the mousedown event handler to body, but removing that package didn't fix the problem.

So I'm left wondering what the problem was and why it only happened with the react editor.

``` js
{type: 'gutter', class: 'my-sweet-class'}
```

And here is how to attach it to a buffer row:

``` coffee
editor.addDecorationToBufferRow(1, {type: 'gutter', class: 'my-sweet-class'})
```

Currently the only thing that renders a decoration is the `GutterComponent` and it only cares about decorations with `type: 'gutter'`. It will add the decoration's `class` property as a class to the proper line-number node in the gutter. 

The neat thing is that the `GutterComponent` handles all the bs with updating as line number nodes are added and removed. So no more watching the `display-updated` event and manually updating classes in packages like `git-diff` and `bookmarks`.
### Markers

There is a marker API as well. Packages like `bookmarks` should not be watching the markers and updating their decorations manually. 

``` coffee
marker = editor.displayBuffer.markBufferRange([[2, 13], [3, 15]], class: 'my-marker', invalidate: 'inside')
decoration = {type: 'gutter', class: 'marker-class'}
editor.addDecorationToMarker(marker, decoration)
```

The class `marker-class` will properly track the marker's rows on the gutter.
### Options

Sometimes you might want a decoration to show on wrapped lines (git-diff), and sometimes you dont (bookmarks), so there is an option: `softWrap`. Like so: `{type: 'gutter', class: 'marker-class', softWrap: true}`. If you have ideas on how better to pass options, let me know.
### Removing decorations

Currently you can only remove them on each buffer row. Like finding markers, it will remove any decoration that matches the pattern.

``` coffee
editor.addDecorationToBufferRow(1, {type: 'gutter', class: 'my-sweet-class', namespace: 'cats'})
editor.addDecorationToBufferRow(1, {type: 'gutter', class: 'my-other-class', namespace: 'cats'})

# this will remove the previous two
editor.removeDecorationFromBufferRow(1, {namespace: 'cats'})

# usually you'll probably just have one class and do this
editor.removeDecorationFromBufferRow(1, {type: 'gutter', class: 'my-other-class'})
```

The api works the same for marker decorations.

My goal is to centralize all decisions about measurement in the `EditorComponent` rather than scattering them through `componentDidUpdate` callbacks like they are currently. This will allow us to perform measurements when the line height, font size, and font family change without updating any components except the root component. Previously we were updating the lines component just to perform measurement, which resulting in multiple wasted update passes per change.

We use `translate3d` to move the `.lines` div around and never actually set the `scrollTop` or `scrollLeft` of the `.scroll-view` that contains them.

However, if the hidden input field ever gets out of the visible area of the scroll view, the browser tries to be helpful and scroll it into view, which changes the `scrollTop` and `scrollLeft` and ruins everything. This PR tries to stop that.
- If we do scroll, we log a warning and auto-correct the problem. I'd like to remove this stop gap once we don't see warnings for a long enough time, but it's better than leaving the editor in a busted state.
- When the editor is blurred, we always park the hidden input at 0, 0. This eliminates some cases where the editor could autoscroll after changing size while unfocused and then being focused.
- Allow 2px for the hidden input when the cursor reaches the end of the longest line. This ensures we don't autoscroll to the right when moving the cursor to the right edge of the editor.

2258,59,4,0,Internals,nathansobo,2014-05-19T20:42:18Z,667,377,16,3,"This PR improves scrolling performance dramatically over the existing React editor. We're still a bit slower than the original editor for large scrolls, but I have some optimizations in mind that I think can put us over the top. Fundamentally, I think getting the lines on the GPU will be the key to feeling smooth, but the GPU is not without its own corner cases and overhead that needs to be overcome. Here are some of my findings in reaching the current design:
- Putting each line and line number on the GPU as its own layer and moving each line individually rather than their containing layer feels really smooth. But unfortunately GPU layers with text on them need to have opaque backgrounds to handle sub-pixel antialiasing correctly on non-retina displays. This means selections can no longer be easily rendered behind the text, and have to be broken up into individual nodes on each line layer. This is really complex, hurts the performance of selecting pretty badly, and causes rendering artifacts on the GPU when we remove selections from lines due to bugs in Chromium. Layer-per-line is a non-option.
- This puts us back to moving a single large `.lines` layer on the GPU that contains the visible lines absolutely positioned in the correct location. We actually need to render ~8 lines above and below the visible viewport in order to prevent Chromium from grouping the repaints when adding removing lines while scrolling.
- Removing the last background selection from the lines layer causes rendering artifacts on the GPU, so we need to leave an empty selection div on the DOM even if there are no selections. This would be fine, except it seems to worsen layer compositing time for some reason. I think this might be caused by the GPU considering the entire region that encompasses both the empty selection and the visible lines, which can be quite large when scrolling far into the document. I want to experiment with moving the selection into the range of the visible lines and see if that improves this.
- The overhead of React's virtual DOM seems to be prohibitive for the lines and line numbers. I've opted to update the DOM manually in the `componentDidUpdate` hook for the `GutterComponent` and `LinesComponent`. I manually construct and parse the HTML, then add and remove nodes from the DOM. Since everything is absolutely positioned, the actual location of lines in the DOM doesn't matter, so I just append them to the end always. This cuts our JS time pretty significantly, but I still think there's room for improvement by recycling DOM nodes by changing their absolute position and `innerHTML` rather than creating and discarding so many nodes when scrolling. Despite needing to resort to such low-level operations, I'm still pretty happy about React. The virtual DOM is a fantastic tool, and it's really easy to drop down to low-level DOM manipulation where needed.

This PR improves the React editor, but it's not yet the holy grail of performance I'm hoping for. That will come next. There's a few more things to do before merging:
- [x] Fix an issue that causes the gutter to be the wrong width in certain situations.
- [x] Get specs passing again after tearing everything apart for performance.
- [x] Update line numbers when max line number digits changes
- [x] Update gutter width when max line number digits changes
- [x] Fix the go-to-line view.
- [x] Preserve the scroll target to prevent sudden halting of velocity scrolling.

If you press ENTER before a line, a new line is introduced by appending ""\n"" before it.
Therefor a previous line of """" is appended before the <TAG>-line.
This line remains unindented, causing a wrong indentation for the next line.
Basically this is fixed by indenting this line (oldBuffer.end.row = newBuffer.start.row).
## Bug Description

As in #1294: If you put the cursor before a tag and press ENTER the indentation get's messed up.

1863,155,2,7,Internals,nathansobo,2014-04-18T00:05:55Z,2332,93,35,6,"This PR is about making it easier to optimize the editor view and harder to introduce changes that de-optimize it.
### Problems with the existing editor

Experience building the original editor view taught us that avoiding extra reflows is essential to good performance. We can optimize the shit out of our JS, but if we read from the DOM after touching it, performance is going to suck. If we want to be fast. It's critical that we batch all reads and writes in a reflow-minimizing way, and the less we access the DOM the better. The DOM needs to be treated with kid gloves.

Another hurdle in optimization is the complexity of the original editor implementation. To minimize DOM updates, we had a headache-inducing region invalidation routine. Combine that with lots of ad-hoc DOM updates for various aspects of the view that have evolved over time, and it's pretty difficult to reason about the behavior of the editor.

The editor is one of Atom's most essential components. It needs to be as fast as possible, and we can't afford to get mired in complexity every time we work on it.
### How React.js helps

The core idea behind React is that you express the state of the DOM at a given point of time declaratively, allowing React to compute a minimal set of DOM updates based on a diff with the previous state. This is great, because one source of confusion in the old editor is the sequence of actions that update the DOM. Now that's all abstracted away. React makes DOM programming similar to traditional server-side web programming, where you get to assume a page refresh in between view states.

Rewriting the editor view was also an opportunity to make other improvements, which were easier thanks to the simplicity afforded by starting with a clean slate and using a superior tool:
- Autoscroll is handled entirely in the model layer, which will avoid expensive DOM reads when moving the cursor and allow us to implement page up, page down, etc as methods on the model.
- The model is now aware of the display width of characters, allowing pixel positions to be computed in the model and paving the way for optimization of extremely long lines. We'll be able to break long lines into smaller chunks and only render what's on screen, just like we only render what lines are on screen in the vertical direction. This is only possible if we know how wide characters are. This also paves the way for soft-wrap based on pixel dimensions rather than wrapping at a specific number of characters, which will address a number of issues with soft wrap with non latin characters. It would also make Atom viable as a more general word processor with first class support for variable width fonts.
- The ""plate glass window"" called the overlayer has been removed. It was present to capture mousewheel events so velocity scrolling didn't jerk to a halt when the target of the scroll event was removed. We now delay removal of lines until after mousewheel events stop firing. Now users can access tokens directly with the DOM inspector, and a bunch of complexity involved in relaying click events between layers can be removed.
- The hidden input is now absolutely positioned relative to the scroll view rather than the content inside it and is never allowed to stray out of the visible bounds of the scroll view. This eliminates code required to avoid Chromium's native autoscroll behavior when the input is focused.
- Detecting of insertion of accented characters has been simplified.
### Deployment plan

Changing editor rendering is a pretty huge deal and there are bound to be issues. This editor view has a superior design for the future, but the existing editor view has been battle tested and is stable. We need feedback about the new editor without forcing people to use it, so my plan is to initially deploy it behind a feature flag. The new editor will only be used if `core.useReactEditor` is true.

Steps:
- [x] Get the test suite green with the feature flag turned off. There were a few small changes to the model layer that affect the original editor that need to work.
- [ ] Get the test suite green with the feature flag turned on. This ensures that shims are in place to at least support Atom's default packages. We can learn what else is missing based on feedback from users.
- [x] Do an optimization pass on the React editor. I satisfied myself that React could be fast enough early on, but then added a bunch of features without paying attention to performance. I don't want to roll it out until it's faster than what exists, so we provide an incentive for people to try it.
- Merge this PR, with some features missing
- Implement additional features in subsequent PRs
  - Invisibles
  - IME character composition support
  - fold decoration
  - page up / page down / etc
- Make the react editor the default when it's stable

There was a deserialization problem. Workspace stores editor instances using `Workspace::addEditor`. But when a workspace is deserialized, editors are created before the `atom.workspace` variable is created, so `Editor` can't call `atom.workspace.addEditor`. This worked before because project is separate from editor creation.

- In addition, if we're ever going to make jQuery optional it's imperative that our Keymap emit native DOM events rather than using jQuery's `.trigger` which won't call handlers registered with the native `.addEventListener` method.

I took the opportunity to address both these issues while extracting the Keymap to its own [npm](https://github.com/atom/atom-keymap) that we can open source. This was basically a ground-up rewrite that heavily borrowed from the previous implementation. Shims are in place so that the old keymap specs were green at the time of deletion.

There are a few methods that weren't appropriate to extract into a generic library for dealing with the built-in and user key bindings. As with the TextBuffer extraction, this is a bit awkward. I opted to add the to the Keymap prototype in `keymap-extensions.coffee`. Other ideas are welcome.

Remaining:
- [x] Iron out broken bindings via manual testing (not a ton of test coverage on key bindings)
- [x] Ensure documentation generates correctly
- [x] Update docs for Keymap class in atom-keymap module
- [x] Test going into pending states recursively

This seems to be needed in order for the dev spec tests to be able to auto-generate some JS via `eval()`.  The stack trace can be found below. So, it would be nice if we could come up with a way to allow unit tests to run without having to directly inherit the CSP policy.  Also, I still need to add a few unit tests.  I just wanted to post the PR early so that folks could chime it regarding anything they think might break, workarounds for any issues that come up, etc.

Refs #1535

This PR should not go green until all bundled modules have a known permissive license. The following issues still need to be resolved:

**Determine whether licenses added in subsequent versions are sufficient or upgrade the following:**
- [x] domutils@1.0.1 (~~submitted a PR to gjtorikian/task-lists-js#2 to upgrade to a licensed dependency~~ now waiting on gjtorikian/roaster#5)

**Add licenses to all libraries controlled by GitHub:**
- [x] clear-cut
- [x] isbinaryfile
- [x] tasks-lists (asked @gjtorikian to publish w/ license in gjtorikian/task-lists-js#1)
- [x] packages derived from permissively-licensed TextMate bundles

**Convince author to add a license or switch to an alternative for the following libraries:**
- [x] replace (requested in harthur/replace#33)
- [x] slug (~~requested in dodo/node-slug#15~~ requested to drop the dependency in gjtorikian/roaster#6)
- [x] specificity (requested via PR in keeganstreet/specificity#7)
- [x] unicode (requested in dodo/node-unicodetable#13)

**Convince authors of unlicensed TextMate bundles we derive from to add licenses.**
- [x] coffee-script-tmbundle (requested in jashkenas/coffee-script-tmbundle/issues/153) just going to allow it for now and work it out later.

Having decided via painful experience that putting telepath into core was a bad idea, this PR removes it. I've replaced non-replication oriented features that were previously handled by telepath with smaller npm packages.
- **[text-buffer](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer)** This handles the storage of text and markers that was previously dealt with in telepath strings. It also implements the undo system for buffers.
- **[theorist](https://github.com/atom/theorist)** This provides a `Model` superclass that will provide the reactive features that proved to be valuable from Telepath models. Model subclasses allow you to subscribe to $-prefixed reactive behaviors for any property, declare derived reactive properties with `.behavior`, and will soon include facilities for defining reactive collections with relational operators. It took me a couple tries to find a good name, so if you see references to `reactionary` or `atomic-model` in commits, that's this library.
- **[serializable](https://github.com/atom/serializable)** This provides a convenient mixin for implementing `::serialize` and `.deserialize`. It's completely optional, meaning anyone can implement those methods on their own, but it removes a lot of the boilerplate. I think this package should also provide the deserializer manager and eventually incorporate support for migrations.

**What's the plan for replication going forward?**

I think I had it exactly backwards. Instead of wrapping a replication layer with the application's model, we should wrap the application's model with a replication layer. I think Telepath should be transformed into an unobtrusive wrapper library that can wrap any JavaScript object graph and automagically replicate it to another site. I think we can pull off something seamless by combining the new ES6 `Object.observe` API, ES5 `WeakMap`s, and everything I learned implementing references in the last attempt. I'd like something like this to be possible:

``` coffee
{Replicant} = require 'telepath'

# start with a plain old javascript object
atomA = new Atom(mode: 'editor') 

# build a replicant wrapper based on this object
replicantA = new Replicant(atomA) 

# replicate it (this is for tests, across the wire we'd serialize)
replicantB = replicantA.replicate(siteId: 2) 

 # extract a fresh plain-old object from the replica
atomB = replicantB.root
```

The end user never needs to interact with telepath. They just modify properties on the plain objects and telepath picks up their changes and replicates them transparently. This keeps telepath out of the critical path for the single-user case because it's bolted on from the outside only when needed. It also means we can expand the scope of replication in an ad-hoc fashion, starting with a single buffer and moving outward.

Finer-grained control of what properties are replicated is still possible on a per-object and per-class basis. Here's a sketch of what I'm thinking:

``` coffee
# exclude instances of an entire class from being replicated
replicant.disable(TreeView)

# only replicate particular properties for instances of a certain class
replicant.enable(Pane, 'items')

# dynamically enable / disable replication for certain instances
replicant.enable(focusManager)
```

Again, the key is we can start small and only pay for what we use.

I've added a platform class to the body element of the Atom window like so `platform-win32` or `platform-darwin`. I'm not sure how everyone feels about this but it's nice in that we can leverage the css selectors we already use for many things.

I've also gone ahead and attempted to implement some of the core bindings that we have on Windows. However it'd be great if @paulcbetts could review/improve those.

@probablycorey I know you've worked on this area a bit recently, any thoughts here?

Since the manner in which platforms handle menus is sufficiently different I think that part is necessary. That said, I would prefer to keep the menu configuration in packages cross platform.

This presents a bit of a challenge because Windows uses `&` to allow navigation through menus via the keyboard. The way that it works is that a user presses `alt` and then windows focuses the menu and underlines characters which indicates the next selection. This means that there needs to be an underlined character for each menu item and it has to be unique within the currently visible menu.

So I propose that during The Great Package Rewrite, that one of the steps that we do is specify an underlined character for all menu items and then strip it on platforms that don't support it (ie darwin and linux). I've worked around this for now by adding a `normalizeLabel` function which allows us to specify top-level menu item's underline character and packages can still merge their menu items appropriately.

@paulcbetts if you'd like to go into menus/win32.cson and add ampersands where you think most appropriate that would be :cool:

This PR updates Atom to a brand new version of [Telepath](https://github.com/atom/telepath-next). It's a ground-up rewrite and better in a number of ways, but the biggest feature is the ability to move subdocuments around in the overall document. That requirement was radical enough that the design assumptions in the original Telepath were worth burning to the ground. This branch drops support for collaboration and deletes the replication specs. They were just too far away from the vision of where we're going and too painful to get working on the new Telepath. I'd like to revisit them after improving the health of the View <=> Model <=> Document correspondence.

Now that we're on a solid foundation that supports moves, we can iterate on this new version of Telepath from here on out. I promise no more rewrites :smile_cat:. Once this lands I'm excited to do an optimized, non-replicated solo mode for arrays and see if it saves us some memory on large documents. Then I plan to resume the ideas discussed in #920.

This brings the [Changer](https://github.com/atom/changer) package tutorial a bit up-to-date. A few things to note:
- I feel pretty strongly about keeping the general package creation docs separate from the ""creating your first package!"" docs. One is a reference, the other is a tutorial. In the interest of not keeping a giant page, I split the two parts.
- I wouldn't merge just yet. I'll still likely need to update _theme-variables.md_ and the companion ""Your first theme!"" docs
- Not that my code is perfect and marvelous, but it might be time to use [panda-docs](https://github.com/gjtorikian/panda-docs) (or some other module) to handle the creation of a mini-docs site, complete with a TOC, anchors for headings, and all that jazz

This upgrades us from jquery `1.7.1` to `2.0.3`.
### Things learned
- jquery focused rules changed a bit and a couple specs needed to be updated to be attached to the DOM. [:link:](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#order-of-triggered-focus-events)
- [triggerHandler](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) has to be used for triggering focus/blur events on the `window` in specs.
- The old hacks for getting jquery to work headless no longer work.  We used to have a fake window object in `task-bootstrap` that shimmed just enough to have it requireable without throwing an error.  These shims no longer work and we shouldn't be used jquery tasks anyway so this has been removed.
- Doing `$(window).trigger 'beforeunload'` in specs causes jquery 2.0 to blow up, wrapping it up in a legit event works.
### Going forward

Packages should now feel free to rely on `space-pen` directly in their `package.json` since it now exports `$`/`jQuery` complete with all [these](https://github.com/atom/space-pen/blob/master/src/jquery-extensions.coffee) extensions.

This also replaces the `MessageChannel` based implementation of  `_.nextTick` with a shim to `setImmediate` since that original method predates us having node support. `_.nextTick` should no longer be used

New packages should depend on this library directly when needed.

:mega::mega::mega:
The only thing that was weird upgrading was that `_.max` now returns a different value if multiple values in the same array produce the same value and that value is the max.  Previously it returned the last element with the max value, now it returns the first element.  We only had one place this mattered, when selecting a grammar in one spec we were relying on the last grammar in the list having precedence when they both generated the same path score.

The proposed fix is to render enough lines to fill the window since the editor does get a window resize event for when it shrinks/grows.
### Steps to reproduce
1. Open Atom with no editors open
2. Do a project find for something with a lot of results so that the view takes up most of the vertical space
3. Open an editor
4. Close the find and replace view
5. The editor is now missing rendered lines

The following screenshot shows this bug, the editor has 37 lines but after the find and replace view is closed only 29 lines are rendered.  Clicking in the editor causes the remaining lines to render.

- [x] When scrolling, the Editor updates the position of the cursors and selection, calling `Editor.positionLeftForLineAndColumn`. When the cursor or selection is on an unrendered line, `Editor` creates the line! 
  - I added a check to only update the cursors and selections when they are within the rendered range (7f83b38)
- [x] `positionLeftForLineAndColumn` is _crazy slow_
  - When scrolling, the cursor doesn't move and the lines dont change, but the Editor still uniquely calculates the left pixel value.
  - I added a cache of line-and-column:pixel-value (the beginnings in 5448da9, finished in 4852f0c)
  - I wrapped each character in a span and changed `positionLeftForLineAndColumn` to get all the character spans, then sum the widths of them. This turned out take ~40% the time of the previous implementation. Yay! See  de9bfb4
- [x] Gutter rendering is slow. It rerenders all gutter numbers when scrolling. The editor only renders the dirty lines. We should rework it so the Editor tells the Gutter to only render the dirty lines. Note: I tried reusing the current nodes rather than regenerating everything all the time and it is marginally faster.
  - Implemented in fdd9e30
- [x] `isVisible` is still slow. Turns out calculating the width and height is slow. In my previous tests the browser must have been caching the size. I want to find another way to calc it or eliminate it from the updateDisplay calcs.
  - Using `css('display') != 'none'` again in de1346d

### Summary
- Sparkle triggers 'ready-for-update-on-quit' in the browser process
- The browser process forwards that event as a command to all of it's render processes.
- Each render process receives that event as a command and triggers it on a rootView.
- Packages that would like to know when an update is available listen to `window:update-available`

Note this branch also adds `updateAvailable` to loadSettings which is passed to AtomWindow (which is available in a browser process by calling `atom.getLoadSettings().updateAvailable`).

I did some profiling and it turns out `isVisible()` is slow. `Editor.updateDisplay` and `Editor.pixelPositionForScreenPosition` both call it every time they are called. And when you switch panes, bookmarks and git-diff use it to check for gutter visibility. 

So, I changed it to not use the `:visible` filter, and just check the display property instead.

This can cause atom to have a delayed startup since it is too eagerly loading things it might not even use.  Now that we have less caching going on it is even more important to only load stylesheets when needed.

If packages are using activation events it should signal that they don't need their stylesheets actually loaded until right before `activate` is called on their package main.

So we'd like to have context menus which populate with menu items based on the DOM element that was right clicked. This branch is a working proposal that does that (there's a corresponding tree-view branch).

I'm thinking that it should follow the pattern we've put forth with keybindings, use a css selector to specify the relevant elements and then list the label and it's corresponding command to trigger. I'd be open to adding this as a dedicated file in the atom package format like keymaps but I feel like it might be nicer to register another export function in packages (something like `registerContextMenus`). Or maybe packages should call onto globals like is done currently. Thoughts?

Long ago CI was a bit flaky as we integrated the building of node modules and atom-shell into atom's build process.

To get it consistently building we decided to have `script/cibuild` be as aggressive as possible in deleting cached files between builds. Everything went, the coffee cache, the local `atom-shell` folder, cached atom-shell zips, the local `node_modules` folder, and the cache of previously downloaded modules.

Things are now significantly less flaky; atom-shell tags releases, we are tagging and publishing our own atom packages, apm rebuilds native modules when atom-shell gets upgraded, and therefore I am proposing we now favor faster build times over a pristine atom build environment.

This will not impact the deploy script, we will still do the super clean and make sure everything builds with fresh copies of all the modules and atom-shell.
# Results

The non-spec portion of atom's build goes from ~4 minutes to ~1 minute.

The last master build when this branch started was [380 seconds](https://janky.rs.github.com/atom/master), the latest build of this branch was [218 seconds](https://janky.rs.github.com/atom/less-clean).

- It has a `theme` attribute which is `true` in the `package.json` file.
- It can have a `stylesheets` attribute which indicates the loading order of the stylesheets.

We decided today that we shouldnt have to write special theme specific css for each package. We didnt want to have a package author open pull requests on each theme, or have to support each theme in their package. Most of the things different between themes is colors. 

So we decided to have some set of variables available to the packages. This pull just adds a colors.less file to each theme, and a fallback less file so packages dont panic when there is no ui theme set. 

Basically, it allows you to import anything from any currently loaded theme that is made of a directory. So

``` css
@import ""colors"";

.my-plugin { background: @background-color-1; }
```

I'm not sure how best to group the colors. Thinking along the lines of this:

``` scss
// Colors get generally darker as the number increases
@background-color-1: #333;
@background-color-2: #202123;
@background-color-3: #1b1c1e;

// Info colors are generally blue
@accent-color-info-1: #66a6ff;
@accent-color-info-2: #0098ff;
@accent-color-info-3: #5293d8;

// Error colors are generally red
@accent-color-error-1: #f78a46;
...

// Success colors are green
@accent-color-success-1: #46f78a;

...
```

Not entirely sure what colors we need yet. 

See #701 for the original pull request.

HACK
- It reloads all the package css each time you add/change a theme. Not fast. Not ideal. 

TODO
- [x] pull all the colors out into the colors.less files, use in respective places when we settle on a naming convention.

### Normalizing pasted text

540,27,0,0,Internals,nathansobo,2013-05-10T19:25:36Z,670,370,13,3,"I've found a way to make mapping performance O(fold-count + wrapped-line-count + 1) instead of O(line-count). For all conceivable cases, the number of folds and wrapped lines will be vastly smaller than the number of lines in the buffer, so this is a big win in performance with extremely large files. We can still use a variant of a skip list to make it O(ln(fold-count + wrapped-line-count)), but this puts off the need to do that since it will only become an issue with huge numbers of folds.

The basic idea is to build a row map that supports the ability to map a buffer or screen row range to a smaller number of rows in the other coordinate system. So a fold of rows 5-10 would look like this (note that the end row is exclusive... it's simpler that way).

``` coffeescript
rowMap.mapBufferRowRange(5, 11, 1)
```

That says that we intend to represent buffer rows 5-11 (end-exclusive) as a single row on screen.

To express a wrapped line, we do the reverse, passing a screen row count (3rd argument) that is larger than the number of buffer rows spanned by the first two arguments:

``` coffeescript
rowMap.mapBufferRowRange(2, 3, 2)
```

That says that rows 2 and 3 on screen actually represent the same row in the buffer, which is what happens when a single buffer line wraps to multiple lines on screen.

And finally, to fold some buffer lines _completely_ away, making them invisible, we'd store tho following mapping:

``` coffeescript
rowMap.mapBufferRowRange(5, 11, 0)
```

Previously, folds were tracked in the display buffer with a custom data structure that had a lot of duplication with the marker code. Now, to create and track folds, we create markers with a class of ""fold"" on the buffer. The markers also have a display buffer id so that folds aren't shared between edit sessions for the same buffer.

This PR also improves marker behavior around undo and redo, ensuring that events are never triggered before the buffer change event is emitted and always restoring the ranges of markers to the state they had before the change being undone / redone. I take advantage of this behavior to restore the selection range around undo/redo automatically, allowing the transaction code in edit session to be simplified.

This fixes issue #505. Whenever a grammar is added / removed, any grammars that include it are updated and their buffers are re-tokenized.

There's one more thing to do: I'm currently updating grammars when their included grammars are added or removed, but I _also_ need to update them if any grammars they include are _updated_. This will allow for transitive cases, like reloading an ERB file if the SQL grammar is loaded, because the Ruby grammar includes the SQL grammar inside of certain kinds of here-doc strings.

I've used Bootstrap on other projects, and really enjoyed having some baseline styles for forms, typography, etc. So far, everything has been super custom so this hasn't come up, but for something like a configuration UI it makes total sense to build on an existing vocabulary.

The main downside is that we're now _normalizing_ the styles of basic elements instead of resetting them completely. But I actually see this as an upside in certain situations. It's easy to zero out styles when they aren't wanted, but harder to supply basic styles over again every time you want elements to look halfway decent.

I realize this decision may be controversial, so what I'd like to do is live with Bootstrap for a while and see how it feels. If it causes problems, we can rip it out. If a designer crafts something better suited to our needs that's better, we can switch. But for now, I want _something_. I imagine we'll end up thoughtfully diverging from it over time, and developing our own vocabulary. But having something to grow off of is a win. Most of its styling is completely opt-in, aside from its default styling of various elements such as headers, but those are really easy to opt out of. I can easily see thoughtfully forking it over time, but I think it gives us a good starting point for a solid CSS vocabulary.

This PR also introduces improvements to our LESS infrastructure, allowing `@import` directives to function properly. It introduces an `octicon-mixins.less` file that makes it dead-simple to apply icons to any element with a mixin, like so: `.mini-icon(octocat)`. Also, where I needed to fix styling that was slightly incompatible with Bootstrap, I took the opportunity to convert CSS files to LESS syntax and clean them up.

As discussed in #222, I'm using [Biscotto](https://github.com/gjtorikian/biscotto) here. Biscotto relies on TomDoc notation for classes and methods. It'll parse your set of files, creating an internal AST, then generate documentation from that. GFM is supported, and you can do [simplified linking](https://github.com/gjtorikian/biscotto#automatically-link-references) to other parts of the code.

At the end, you get a neat summary:

```

```

Those are actual results--this PR is currently covering 51% of _src/app_.

---

You can find a list of what's remaining by running `biscotto --listMissing ./src/app/`. The majority of stuff that's not listed is simply stuff I didn't understand. For example:
- I'm not really clear on how markers work--and the distinction between buffer-markers and display-buffer markers. Do they just define the start/tail and end/head of a selection?
- Does anything in _atom-package_, _atom-theme_, or _atom_ need to be marked as `Public`?
- I'm not sure what `LineMap` does.
- I skipped a majority of the `LanguageMode` / grammar stuff since I'm not sure if that ought to be marked public either. Would people want to mess with the tokenization?

I'll try to find one of you this week to answer some questions about how some of these internals work? Or should some of them indeed be simply `Internal`?

Some other assumptions:
- In most cases, I marked `constructor`, `initialize`, and `destroy` as `Internal`. I used my best judgement here. For example, a user would probably never initiate a new `Fold`--they'd use `createFold` instead.
- By the same logic, _serialize_ and _deserialize_ are marked `Internal`. My understanding is that these are called internally so there's no need to run them by yourself.

- Streaming search results. `populateSingle` is called each time the `BufferedProcess` gets another chunk of information. (This is guaranteed to always be a path followed by the results, so there's no risk of lost information.)
- The fuzzy file finder now implements `nak` as well. It takes about a second to perform a full retrieve on `~/github/github`, without includes. (The dir-walker I wrote is actually the fastest part, and you can also set up file/dir ignores.)
- By default, `nak` includes your ignore files. `config.set(nak.addVCSIgnores, true)` if you need them excluded.

1. `Rakefile` invokes the new `script/generate-sources-gypi` script to generate `sources.gypi`. This file lists all the `.coffee`/`.cson` files in the `src`, `static`, and `vendor` directories, as well as a new `compiled_sources_dir` variable that specifies where the compiled versions of the files should be placed.
2. `atom.gyp` includes `sources.gypi`.
3. `atom.gyp` has a new target, `generated_sources`, which contains all the `.coffee`/`.cson` files, and uses two rules to tell gyp how to compile them. The rules invoke the new `script/compile-coffee` and `script/compile-cson` files once for each file.
4. gyp generates one `Makefile` for each rule to actually perform the compilation.
5. `script/copy-files-to-bundle` now takes the `compiled_sources_dir` variable as an argument, and copies files both from there and from the repository into the `Resources` directory.

By putting the compilation into a different target, we can do it in parallel with compiling/linking our binaries. And gyp automatically runs `make` using `-j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`, so compilation of `.coffee`/`.cson` files happens in parallel, too.

Note that this means that there's no compile- or link-time separation between main process code and helper process code. We could introduce a compile-time separation by building main process and helper process code into separate static libraries with mutually exclusive include paths, if we want.

Atom.framework exports a single symbol: `AtomMain()`. `Atom.app` and `Atom Helper.app` contain a single source file: `main.cpp`. `main()` just calls `AtomMain()`.

All frameworks are placed in `Atom.app/Contents/Frameworks`. We now link against all frameworks using `@rpath`-based install names, which allows `Atom.app` and `Atom Helper.app` to find them automatically based on their own `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATH` settings. We use `install_name_tool` at build time on each of our three binaries (`Atom.app`, `Atom Helper.app`, `Atom.framework`) to set the install names.

The central idea of this pull request is that anybody should be able to add items to panes. Right now, panes, tabs, and other functionality is very hard-coded to the editor use case. But what about opening an image viewer / editor or a markdown preview? Or something else? Our current arrangement falls down.

Now, panes are a much more central part of the view system. Panes have multiple items, and pane items can either be regular views _or_ they can be model objects. When you add a model object as a pane item, that object needs a `getViewClass` method to instruct the pane on how it should be rendered.

So now, instead of editors managing multiple edit sessions, edit sessions will just be added as pane items, and the pane will attach an editor and assign its edit session when it needs to render an edit session item. Any other types of items can follow a similar course.

Everything is ripped apart right now, but that's the goal.
- [x] Extract a pane container view for dealing with pane layout and other pane-spanning behavior
- [x] Make pane-splitting general, so that editor / edit session don't need to know about it

Markers are stored in the buffer, and are kept in the same logical location when the buffer changes just like anchors and anchor ranges were previously. Markers combine anchors and anchor ranges into a single construct... basically you can think of a marker as being like a selection. It marks a region of the buffer, with a head and an optional tail. In fact, each cursor / selection pair is now just another layer on top of a single marker in the buffer.

Markers are identified with a label string, which is currently auto-generated whenever you add a marker. In the future, we plan on allowing you to specify your own marker names, and even scoping them (`name.scope`) like you can with jQuery events.

One cool thing about markers is that if they are invalidated, undoing the operation that invalidated them will restore the marker. This will help with nested snippet tab stops, because if you type in the outer tab stop and then undo your change, the inner tab stops will be restored.

You can observe a marker at the buffer level or the display buffer level, and your callback will be fired whenever the head or tail positions change. If you observe at the display buffer level (via `EditSesson`), you'll be notified if either their buffer or screen positions change.

This is just a first step in what I think will become a very important core facility in Atom. I want markers to closely follow the regions of the buffer they mark. For example, if you cut and paste a region with markers, the markers should go with it. If you duplicate a line with markers, you should duplicate the markers. I want this to be the basis of determining what regions of the code are folded, so that you can copy and paste folded lines.

- [x] switch to `config.core.disabledExtensions` rather than `config.core.extensions`

- [x] make textmate bundles work in the packages directory
- [x] load themes from `~/.atom/themes` (or the bundle's default themes), based on the `core.themes` config key
- [x] add scoped configuration facility

Previously, we were tokenizing the entire file when we constructed the `TokenizedBuffer`, but for big files this was really slow. It locked up the UI thread for like 5-6 seconds loading jQuery. This PR makes that process asynchronous. We render lines in an untokenized form initially, then tokenize them one chunk at a time in the background while yielding back to the UI thread between chunks.

**This still isn't good enough, but it's a start.** This approach still consumes a lot of time on the UI thread, so even though we haven't locked it completely, performance is still pretty crappy during tokenization. To _truly_ tokenize in the background, we need to use a worker thread or another process. That will allow the UI to be super responsive even while we are tokenizing. I'll give it a try if we can manage to switch to [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).

The big deal here is that we know update the editor's display on `nextTick`, which we implement with a MessageChannel hack. This means that when an event triggers multiple changes, (like a change in the selection, the cursor position, and the lines in the editor, for example) we don't touch the DOM at all until the end of the event cycle. To do these, we needed to batch up update events on the editor and then have a way of rendering them all at once. Now typing a character updates the screen without any extraneous reflows.

Also, it turns out that blinking the cursor with a CSS animation causes Atom to be less responsive because WebKit is busy sampling the editor's display 60 times a second and sometimes our keystrokes miss a frame. Blinking with a timer is better, so that's what we do now.

# Motivation

When we added support for automatic insertion of paired characters, we only wanted to perform auto-insertion in certain syntactic scopes. For example, we didn't want to insert a matching single quote if we were already inside a string, since in a string a single quote is more likely an apostrophe. 

Previously, we were relying on the tokenizer from the Ace editor to do all of our syntax highlighting, but we didn't want to start building editor features like scope-aware character insertion based on Ace's grammar and scopes. They just didn‚Äôt seem well-designed and ubiquitous enough to really serve as the foundation for other serious features.

We‚Äôd been thinking about supporting TextMate for a while, but it just seemed like a lot to bite off when Ace already had a tokenizer we could use. But now the time felt right: TextMate feels like a better solution in the long term based on its well-designed vocabulary of scopes and vast array of language grammars available. There are also a ton of TextMate themes out there that use these same scopes as the basis of their highlighting. SublimeText 2 also uses TextMate language bundles. All in all, supporting TextMate bundles allows us to tap into a vibrant, well-designed ecosystem for language support. If we proceed to develop more sophisticated syntax-awareness, the coherent vocabulary of syntactic scopes could be a viable foundation.
# Implementation Details

So, with this pull request, we say goodbye to Ace. We‚Äôre not sad about it. Now we have 100% ownership of all of our critical code, and no longer have areas that feel like an Atom-Ace-Frankenstein. Tokenization is now handled completely by our own code, using TextMate language property lists for its rules. Because TextMate grammars rely on special features of the Oniguruma regular expression engine (also used by Ruby 1.9), we needed to add a native extension that gave us access to `OnigRegExp` objects. Our Oniguruma regexes are a bit slower than we‚Äôd like, despite extensive profiling and optimization. A newer version of CEF allows us to allocate JavaScript arrays with a non-zero initial size, which should help a bit more. But we‚Äôre pretty sure we‚Äôre going to need to handle tokenization asynchronously due to the slowness of our regexes. This is something we needed to do anyway to load extremely large files quickly, even with our previous tokenizer based on the faster stock regex engine.

We‚Äôre also parsing TextMate themes and converting them to CSS, with TextMate‚Äôs CSS-like scope selectors making this a natural process. One difference: TextMate supports dotted scope selectors and matches on prefixes. For example, a scope of `variable.assignment.coffee` in the grammar can match the selector of `variable` in a theme. Our solution is to expand out every potential prefix when rendering elements. So the span representing the variable assignment token would have `variable`, `variable-assignment`, and `variable-assignment-coffee` as classes. That way any level of specificity in the translated theme stylesheets can match it.

It integrates with the same command-oriented interface that we use to search a single document. In the _Sam command language_, `X` is composed with other commands to run a search across multiple files, like this:

```
X/.*\.c/ /void/  # find all occurrences of 'void' in files with a .c extension
X s/vim/atom # substitute vim with atom in all files
```

`X` is the analog of `x`, which loops over matches in a single file. `X` loops over files in the project.

We've implemented only an extremely small subset of this so far: `Xx`. This composes scanning the file system with selecting all matches in a file. Whenever we detect a multi-file operation, we automatically display the results of the operation in a preview pane above the command panel's mini-editor, like this:

![Screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s199/sh/73d4510e-f6a2-4013-b354-7d77687a6d1a/da0894a7fbe9aae931b5ba543e4c0b5e/res/1ffc5064-fe6e-4e53-a683-be0c707f15c3/_Users_nathansobo_code_atom_src_app_edit-session.coffee-20120725-142519.jpg.jpg)

Clicking any of these operations will open the associated file and select the match in the active editor. We still need to add features to this menu, which will include a tree-like display based on file's location in the project tree and the ability to include / exclude results once we enable find/replace in addition to just find.

This feature is implemented in terms of a search program written in C called _The Silver Searcher_. We include a compiled version inside the app bundle. We'll have to include alternate version for different platforms when the time comes. This pull request also includes the first API for running a child process, which we had to use to run the search program.

We realized that the undo manager potentially needed to undo/redo more than just changes to the buffer, but also state associated with those changes. In this case, when you remove the text inserted by the snippet, you also need to destroy the snippet's extra state.

This led to an overhaul of the UndoManager class. Previously, it was tightly coupled to Buffer, observing its changes. Now UndoManager takes generic operation objects, which have optional `do`, `undo`, and `redo` methods. The `do` and `redo` methods are similar, except `redo` is only triggered when redo-ing, whereas do is triggered on the initial push to the undo manager as well.

We used this new generic facility to manage selection state as well. Previously, each ""transaction"" object in the undo manager was associated with an array of ranges that were selected before / after the transaction. Now, `EditSession` has a `transact` method that pushes operations before / after the rest of the transaction to manage selection state on undo / redo.

One further detail is that the undo and redo methods take an optional `editSession` argument. This can be used to contextualize _where_ the undo/redo is being performed. This is necessary, for example, when we undo a change to the same buffer in another editor. We don't want to restore the selection in the other editor, but in the current editor.

I think this helps you keep buffers organized. You can put all the specs on the right pane, for instance, but still quickly jump to an open spec from any pane without opening it there. It eliminates having to switch first to the desired pane before opening the desired buffer. Now, you only have to decide which pane to put a buffer in when you open it, and then quick-find to switch to it there in the future.

To implement this, I added an option to RootView.open called 'allowActiveEditorChange'. If this is true (defaults to false), the call to open may switch to another editor to recycle an existing edit session for the given path. It will always try to recycle edit sessions on the current active editor.
